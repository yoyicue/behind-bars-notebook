# 14. Strings

## Clefs

Various clefs are used in music for strings. The Violin appears in the treble clef only. The Viola appears in the alto clef primarily, although higher notes may move into the treble clef. Cello and double bass appear in the bass clef primarily, with the tenor clef for a higher range and the treble clef for even higher notes. (The practice of using the treble clef in cello parts to sound an octave lower than written is obsolete.)

For Viola, cello and double bass, use the lowest-pitched clef where possible: allow two or three ledger lines above the stave before moving to a higher-pitched clef. In the treble and tenor clefs, notes occurring towards the bottom of the stave, or below it, are difficult to read (the player is unaccustomed to reading them); such notes should move into a lower-pitched clef.

The double bass is written an octave higher than sounding: this transposition avoids ledger lines below the bass clef. The figure '8' may be written below its clefs; this is particularly useful to clarify the sounding pitches of harmonics (see Double bass harmonics, p. 423).

For any of the stringed instruments, octave signs may be used in the treble clef for very high notes (five ledger lines or more) to avoid multiple ledger lines. No other octave signs are acceptable.

**TABLE 1: Open strings and clefs**

[musical example]

(See also Using ledger lines or octave signs, p. 32, and Changing Clef, p. 7.)

## String designation

The strings are labelled either by pitch letter (E, A, D, C, etc.) or roman numeral: I = highest, IV = lowest (V = lowest for a 5-string double bass).

A passage on a given string that is designated a pitch letter should be preceded by *sul* (Italian, 'on'), e.g. *sul G* ('on the G string'). The use of *sul* is unnecessary with roman numerals (only in elementary educational material is a roman numeral used to refer to left-hand position on the fingerboard). The extended use of a specified string may be indicated *IV sempre* or *sul G sempre*, or its precise length defined by a dotted line:

[musical example]

(If necessary an end bracket may indicate where to stop playing on the specified string. In the Debussy extract above the subsequent bars can be played only on the G string, rendering an end bracket redundant.)

A string should be specified only in order to achieve a particular timbre or to indicate how to play a technically complex passage. Place the string designation above the stave; only where there is a lower line with a separate stem does the designation go below the stave:

[musical example]

## Open strings

A zero indicates an open string. (An open string is not indicated by a string number.) The lowest open string does not need an open-string indication since this pitch cannot be played in any other way. Each repeated open-string note requires a zero. It is optional to repeat the zero on a tied note (although in certain circumstances it is useful to do so, to confirm that the pitch should not become stopped on a lower string subsequently). Place the zero above the stave:

[musical example]

The zero goes below the stave for the lower of two parts sharing a stave (a). Place the zero beside a note if it is necessary to indicate that a middle note of a chord is an open string (b):

[musical example]

The zero also goes below the stave for the lower note of a double-stopped chord (see One open-string note, p. 397; also, Multiple-stopping with open strings, p. 399).

### Alternating the same pitch on two or more strings

'Bariolage' is the term used to describe the effect of achieving contrasting tone colour in which one string is open, the other stopped.

Unless rhythms are particularly complicated, it is usual to indicate alternating strings with opposite stem directions. The lower string takes down-stems. The upper string is the open-string pitch: add a zero to the first up-stemmed note to clarify that this is the open-string note. Both stems may take beams for the same beat (bar 2) or even a whole bar (bar 3), provided this is the correct beaming for an equivalent single-stemmed part. (This is an acceptable convention even though each beam does not join all the notes of the beat.)

[musical example]

It is better to clarify complex rhythms by preserving beaming intact. Label alternating strings individually:

[musical example]

Label the alternation of more than two strings individually:

[musical example]

## Fingering

In general, fingering is a matter of personal preference and should be included (if at all) only in solo repertoire and educational music. Place fingering above the stave, above articulation and harmonic symbols and below a bowing sign or string indication. Fingering for chords may be stacked alongside (before them, where room), so as to be closer to the relevant notes. The symbol ℗ (and not the snap pizzicato symbol (Ф, see p. 411) indicates thumb position for cello and double bass:

[musical example]

(See also Positioning symbols, p. 427.)

## Double-stopping

The bow can sustain two notes at once on adjacent strings. The two parts are written on a single stave except in very exceptional circumstances (see Use of two staves, p. 399). Two identical note-values share a stem. When the two strings have different note-values, use separate stems. Slur a moving part for the length of the bow stroke required by the longer duration:

[musical example]

(For the relationship between slurs and bow strokes, see Combined-note bowing, p. 401.)

In two-part writing for a single instrument, the length of bow strokes must coincide between the parts. Each part requires an individual slur:

[musical example]

The upper string takes up-stems, even if the lower string has higher pitches:

[musical example]

### Double-stopping with open strings

#### BOTH NOTES ON OPEN STRINGS

Place a zero for each note above the stave. When the lowest two open strings form a chord they do not need zeros, as there is no other way to play them:

[musical example]

#### ONE OPEN-STRING NOTE

It is necessary to add an open-string indication only when a chord could otherwise be played with both notes stopped. For single-stemmed chords, place the zero above or below the stave, according to whether the open string is the higher or the lower note. In a double-stemmed chord, the zero goes to the end of the open string's stem ((a), second beat). When a chord cannot be played in any way other than with one open string, the zero is redundant (b):

[musical example]

When a chord contains adjacent notes, place the zero above or below the correct notehead:

[musical example]

#### UNISON DOUBLE-STOPPING
A unison double-stop is best written with two noteheads. Two noteheads clarify that two strings are played:

[musical example]

The use of two stems to one notehead usually indicates a unison in a part divided between players (each player plays the note on only one string). Only where the notation of two noteheads would be cumbersome should two stems be used to indicate a unison double-stop:

[musical example]

(In two-part writing for a single instrument, two stems should be used for a unison of two voices, since two noteheads would imply two strings.)

Where a unison is at an open-string pitch, one of the notes will be played as an open string (as in (a) below), unless there is an alternative instruction (b). An open-string zero may be added where an open string is to be used, although the open-string indications in examples (a) are not essential:

[musical example]

(See also Multiple-stopping with open strings, opposite.)

## Triple- and quadruple-stopping

Three- and four-note chords are spread by bowing the lower two notes first, unless otherwise indicated by a downward arrow. The convention is to hold the final pair of notes (the speed at which the chords are spread and whether the first notes are placed on or before the beat depends on context):

[musical example]

It is equally acceptable to use grace notes (as above) to show that arpeggiation is required: otherwise notes will be sounded as simultaneously as possible.

One or more of the notes that starts a sustained chord may take shorter note-values. Crotchet noteheads can be joined to the same stem as minims or dotted minims. To indicate that only one note is to be sustained throughout, give full duration to this note alone (see last example):

[musical example]

Quaver notes take opposite stem directions, though complementary rests are not needed:

[musical example]

When each note is to be sounded separately, notate each as such, either in a prescribed rhythm or as a group of grace notes. Reserve the arpeggio sign for pizzicato chords: its use on a bowed chord creates an ambiguity as to how many notes should be sustained at the top of the chord:

[musical example]

### Multiple-stopping with open strings

Open-string pitches may be indicated when it would otherwise be possible to play a chord with some open-string notes stopped (a). To notate a unison triple-stop, assign a notehead for each string, together with string indication (b):

[musical example]

## Use of two staves

### Widely spaced intervals for cello and double bass

Two staves facilitate the simultaneous use of the treble and bass clefs for chords or passages with widely spaced intervals. For the occasional chord, the second stave need be present only for the beats or bars that contain the wide intervals. Allocate all other notation, including rests, to the main stave only:

[musical example]

(If the freestanding stave sections — as in the example above — look too 'floating', attach them to the nearest barline.)

When the two staves are needed more frequently, allocate rests to both staves (dynamics, too, if required) and bar the staves together:

[musical example]

#### ORCHESTRAL CONTEXT

In an orchestral part, it is clearer to keep non-divided chords on one stave, provided it is feasible to read the ledger lines. A part on two staves will look as if it is to be divided between players:

[musical example]

(Such ledger lines below a stave should be reserved for these exceptional cases, as players are unused to reading them.)

### To clarify part-writing

In extreme cases two staves may be used to clarify part-writing, e.g. when pitches overlap on different strings:

[musical example]

Note that a curly brace should always be used to indicate that one instrument is using two staves. A square bracket joins staves for different players (see Score brackets and barlines, p. 514).

## Bowing definitions

The term for a bowed note is *arco*. A note is assumed to be bowed unless indicated to be plucked: *pizzicato*. The term *arco* cancels *pizzicato*. These terms appear in roman type in the music (see Text typefaces in the music, p. 492).

### Combined-note bowing

A slur indicates notes to be played in one bow stroke. A slur in string music should always indicate bowing: one slur = one bow stroke.

It is best to avoid adding phrase marks to string writing as these will be confused with bowing slurs (see also Legato bow strokes, p. 402).

Notes that require a degree of separation within one bow stroke should take individual articulation marks, such as staccato dots (see Slurred staccato, p. 402).

The notes of a pitch repeated in the same bow stroke must be separately articulated. Therefore assign articulation marks for the notes within the bowing slur:

[musical example]

(See also Portato (Loure bowing), p. 403.)

### Separate-note bowing

This is known as *detaché* bowing, although it is not necessarily the case that each note is detached: the bowing may be either legato or non legato (see p. 402). Skilled players can join successive separate-note bow strokes without a break in the sound.

The term *detaché* indicates separate-note bowing after a passage of combined-note bowing.

### Legato bow strokes

Legato playing — keeping the bow on the string between strokes — should be indicated by the verbal instruction *legato*. It is better to use this indication rather than to add phrase marks, to avoid confusion between phrasing and bowing.

An exception may be made if bowing is to be non-synchronous within an orchestral section. In this case phrasing may be given, together with an indication that bow changes are not synchronized (see Unsynchronized bow changes, p. 405).

### Non-legato bow strokes

These may be marked *non legato* or with staccato dots. At a certain speed the natural spring of the bow causes it to bounce from the string between strokes. The player may choose to articulate the strokes on the string (i.e. without the bow leaving the string) or off the string (see below).

## Bowing techniques

Except for *legato* and *non legato*, there is no general consensus about the exact interpretation of terms for various bowing techniques. It is more important to give a *legato* or *non legato* instruction than to prescribe a specific technique, since the player will choose the appropriate way of interpreting the musical instruction. However, the following on- and off-the-string bowings may be indicated as shown below.

### On-the-string bowing

On-the-string bowing is assumed unless there is a contrary instruction. The term *sulla corda* ('on the string') cancels off-the-string playing (see Off-the-string bowing, opposite).

#### SLURRED STACCATO

Staccato marks placed within a slur indicate that the bow stops between notes:

[musical example]

(At a fast tempo such figures would have to be played so that the bow bounces off the string between notes.)

Hooked bowing: this is a technique in which the bow stops before the second note in order to articulate it. It is the first note, rather than the second, that is shortened, although the articulation marks suggest the opposite:

[musical example]

#### MARTELLATO

*Martellato* (in Italian) or *martelé* (in French; both abbrev. *mart*) is an on-the-string staccato in which each stroke sounds hammered and where there is an audible gap between each note.

To indicate that the bow should stay on the string, always include the instruction *martellato* (otherwise the player may choose to bounce the bow) and add staccato dots or wedges, with or without accents (see example, p. 603).

#### PORTATO (LOURE BOWING)
Two or more notes per bow stroke are slightly separated by leaning on the start of each note. Swift and full-length bow strokes produce an intense *cantabile*. The notation is standard and does not require an explicit instruction. Each note takes a tenuto line, and a bowing slur indicates the number of notes per bow stroke:

[musical example]

### Off-the-string bowing

The bow bounces from the string between each note, to give a pronounced staccato. Staccato dots, with slurs for bow strokes as appropriate, are the standard notation. It is best to prescribe *off the string* and leave the player to use the appropriate technique. The more specific terms for off-the-string bowing — *spiccato* and *saltato* (or *saltando*) — are open to different interpretations by the various schools of string playing.

Prescribe *gettato* (Italian, 'thrown') or *jeté* (in French) for a ricochet effect. The bow is dropped on the string and allowed to bounce of its own accord, with the resulting ricochet capturing as many notes as can be articulated in the rebounding bow. Notate a ricochet as a group of staccato notes within a slur.

The use of grace notes indicates that the rhythm is the result of the bounced bow. Otherwise short note-values may be accompanied by an *ad lib.* instruction to suggest the flexible rhythm:

[musical example]

### Two-note tremolos

When a tremolo between two notes is played in one bow stroke, place a slur between the two notes. The tremolo will be either between two fingers on one string ('the finger tremolo'), or between two strings ('the bow and finger tremolo'):

[musical example]

When tremolo note-values are repeated within one bow stroke, use a single slur. A slur should always indicate the length of the bow stroke (there should not be separate slurs for each two-note tremolo unless each has a separate bow stroke). To use two sets of slurs is confusing, as it is unclear whether a second set functions as bowing or phrasing:

[musical example]

When a two-note tremolo is articulated by separate bow strokes, there is a change of bow and finger, or bow and string, for each note. This technique is much less commonly used than the slurred tremolo, so clarify that bow changes are required:

[musical example]

(See also Two-note tremolos, p. 225.)

### Bowing marks

Down-bow: travelling towards the point ⊓  
Up-bow: travelling towards the heel ⋁

Bow direction choices should be left to the player, since either direction can very often achieve the required effect (especially as regards accentuation). Indicate the relevant articulation, and leave the player to find the best bowing to achieve this. Bowing may be prescribed for educational music but should otherwise be reserved for very special techniques, e.g. where the bowing contradicts what would normally be used (see following example).

Place a bowing mark over the stave, aligned with the first note of the bow stroke and above all other markings (see Positioning symbols, p. 427):

[musical example]

Where two instruments share a stave in a score, the bowing symbols for a lower part are inverted below the stave. However, since the up-bow sign can be mistaken for an accent, it is best not to place two parts on one stave where bowing is to be included — and most certainly not if the score is to be played from:

[musical example]

#### UNSYNCHRONIZED BOW CHANGES

These may be indicated by an instruction such as *change bow freely*. Alternatively, for a single held duration, group bow-change indications above the first note (a), or spread them over the course of the held pitch (b):

[musical example]

### Specific section of the bow

The player will always find the section of the bow where a required effect works best. The specifications *at the heel* (Italian: *al tallone*) and *at the point* (Italian: *alla punta*) should be reserved for an effect that demands an unconventional bow placing or when the player would not necessarily play exclusively in that part of the bow.

## Bow pressure

### FLAUTANDO

*Flautando* ('flute-like') indicates a fast and lightly drawn bow that produces a transparent or flute-like sound. *Ord.*, *nat.*, or *norm.* may cancel the term, if required.

### EXCESSIVE PRESSURE

The bow sticks to, or scratches, the string to produce predominantly extraneous noises and overtones. A verbal instruction should explain the technique, such as 'press bow firmly on string to produce scratching noise'. No special notation is required although a series of accents may be added after the note to convey the sense of uneven sound production:

[musical example]

A filled-in wedge placed above the stave indicates the gradation of bow pressure in a graphic way:

[musical example]

(See also Symbols to replace repeated techniques, p. 494.)

## With the wood of the bow

The term *col legno battuto* (abbrev. *col legno batt*/*c.l.batt*/*c.l.b*) indicates tapping the string with the wood of the bow. It is often abbreviated to *col legno*. This technique is usually accompanied by staccato dots or wedges, and produces a staccato.

The term *col legno tratto* (abbrev. *c.l.t*) indicates drawing the wood of the bow across the string.

The term *poco col legno* or *1/2 col legno* indicates using both the hair and the wood of the bow on the string simultaneously.

A return to normal bowing is indicated *arco ord.*, *arco nat.*, or *arco norm.* (*ord.*, *nat.*, or *norm.*, without the instruction *arco*, is less clear — see Cancelling instructions, p. 426):

[musical example]

## Area of the string on which to bow

### NEAR THE BRIDGE

This is indicated *sul ponticello* (abbrev. *sul pont*/*s.p*/*ponti*). Although this means literally 'on the bridge', the bow moves close to but does not touch the bridge (but see Bowing areas producing sounds of indefinite pitch, p. 408).

The following terms indicate the progression of the bow towards the bridge:

| verbal instruction | technique |
|--------------------|-----------|
| *poco sul pont.* | moving towards the bridge |
| *sul pont.* | near the bridge |
| *molto sul pont.* | as close to the bridge as possible |

(See also On the bridge, p. 408.)

### OVER THE FINGERBOARD

This is indicated *sul tasto* (abbrev. *s.t*/*tasto*). It is not always necessary to cancel this instruction since the bow must move further from the fingerboard for any dynamic other than very soft.

### Moving bow position on the string

An arrow indicates moving the bow from one area of the string to another. Trim the length of the arrow to reflect the duration of this transition (see following two examples).

A non-standard bow position should be either confirmed in brackets at each new entry (see last bar, below) or cancelled by *ord.*, *nat.* or *norm.* for the following *arco* note — bar 5 (a pizzicato note is assumed to be played in its normal position unless otherwise indicated):

[musical example]

## Bowing areas producing sounds of indefinite pitch

### ON THE BRIDGE

This is indicated *arco on the bridge*. Italian musicians use the grammatically correct term *sul ponticello* or, simply, *ponticello* to mean 'near the bridge', and *sul ponticello* or *sopra il ponticello* for playing on the bridge. Whichever terms are used, it is helpful to clarify the technique with a performance instruction.

### BEHIND THE BRIDGE

Indicate this *arco*/*pizz. behind the bridge* (Italian: *arco*/*pizz. dietro al pont*).

Use crossed noteheads at the relevant open-string pitches to distinguish these indeterminate sounds from prescribed pitches:

[musical example]

The following symbols may be attached to the relevant stems and adopted for repeated use (to avoid copious instructions), as long as they are defined at their first appearance. The symbols reflect the curved shape of the bridge:

| symbol | meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⊓ | on the bridge |
| ⋁ | behind the bridge |

## Pizzicato

A plucked string is indicated by the abbreviation *pizz.*

### Length of pizzicato notes

Pizzicato notes should take convenient note-values. Plucked notes higher up a string that cannot be sustained beyond a brief duration should not take long note-values. Conversely, do not imitate the brevity of such notes by using very short note-values that make the rhythms difficult to read:

[musical example]

Use staccato dots only to indicate that pizzicato notes are to be shorter than their natural resonance and must be damped (it is useful to add *secco* ('dry') at their first appearance, for clarity — see bar 1, below). A passage may be labelled *secco* when pizzicato notes are to be damped as indicated by the rests (bars 3-4).

A *laissez vibrer* tie indicates that the note should be sustained for as long as possible (i.e. a stopped note to be sustained with vibrato or an open string undamped):

[musical example]

### Pizzicato chords

#### NOTES PLUCKED SIMULTANEOUSLY

To indicate this, place a vertical square bracket | in front of individual chords. (Use the indication *sim.* for successive chords or passages.) Alternatively, give the instruction *non arpeggiando* (abbrev. *non arpegg.* /*non arp.*).

#### ARPEGGIATED CHORDS

Place the standard wavy arpeggio line in front of individual arpeggiated chords; for a passage, use *arpeggiando* (abbrev. *arpegg.*/*arp.*; see Arpeggiated chords, p. 131).

### Strumming

#### INDIVIDUAL CHORDS
A finger strums across the strings as fast as possible so that the notes of the chord sound almost simultaneously. Depending on context, chords that have neither an arpeggio sign nor a vertical bracket may well be strummed, especially for a chord of medium to loud dynamic.

Place a straight arrow in front of a chord to show specifically that a chord should be strummed (as opposed to either being divided between players or else arpeggiated). Use a downward arrow to show that the strum is from the top string down; an upward arrow indicates the opposite direction:

[musical example]

#### MEASURED RHYTHMS

*Pizz. alla chitarra* or *quasi chitarra* ('plucked like a guitar') indicates that repeated rhythms on one or more strings are strummed in both directions — backwards and forwards like a guitar (to some composers this indication also instructs violin or viola players to hold their instruments like a guitar, but this must be the decision of the individual player):

[musical example]

Normally there is no need to specify chord direction: chords on strong beats are strummed from the bottom string upwards. The player will work out the appropriate directions for each chord. However, if it is useful to do so, indicate directions with vertical arrows either above or before the chord. Up- and down-bow symbols should not be used for strumming, since they are needlessly ambiguous, and the direction of the strumming is confusing for cello and bass players:

[musical example]

Note that it is clearest if an arrow always refers to direction of pitch. If the arrow has another definition, then an instruction must clarify this. (For example, a downward arrow might indicate a downward physical hand movement across the strings, towards the floor for violin and viola, i.e. playing from the bottom string upwards. This would be the opposite of the actual intention.)

### Pizzicato tremolo

An unmeasured pizzicato tremolo may be played by using more than one finger in the same direction to achieve a sustained sound. It is written as an ordinary tremolo and indicated *pizz. trem.*:

[musical example]

### Snap pizzicato (Bartok pizzicato)

The string is pulled away sufficiently from the fingerboard for the string to rebound off it when released. The symbol Ф was invented by Bartok for this technique. It can also be used inverted (see table under Cancelling instructions, p. 426). The symbol ℗ represents thumb position for cello and double bass and should not be used for snap pizzicato.

Place the snap pizzicato symbol directly above each note to which it applies. It is advisable to cancel the symbol with *ord.*, *nat.*, or *norm.*, or *pizz. ord.*, etc., so that there is no ambiguity as to whether a further symbol might simply have been omitted:

[musical example]

### Slurred pizzicato

A slur indicates that notes are to be played by the left hand after the string is plucked just once (a). Add a verbal instruction for clarification such as 'within pizzicato passages, notes included in the slur indicate left-hand fingering only'. This technique is often used with a glissando ((b) below; see also Bartok extract, p. 143).

Since the sound dies away quickly, it is not always necessary to notate a finishing pitch for the glissando (c):

[musical example]

### Other types of pizzicato

To notate a pizzicato with the fingernail, use the fingernail sign ⊿ or ⋁ (as used in harp notation) and place it over each respective note. For clarity, add the instruction *fingernail* or *nail* at its first appearance:

[musical example]

Further variations of pizzicato are best given a verbal instruction where they arise, although symbols may be adopted for repeated use as long as an initial verbal instruction accompanies each. Whilst common symbols have not evolved, Ligeti's scores are generally regarded as a benchmark for such techniques (see, for example, *Apparitions*, and the Second String Quartet).

## Left-hand finger work

### The finger slap

The left hand may finger pitches on the string without the right hand bowing or plucking. State in an instruction (such as *finger percussion*, or as below) that the fingering is performed without the bow (a). In addition, each affected note may be notated with a cross through the stem, to alert the reader to this unusual technique. This notation is efficient for repeated use (b):

[musical example]

### Left-hand pizzicato

Place a '+' sign above the stave for each left-hand pizzicato note or chord; in two-part writing, the sign goes to the relevant stem end. When the same or different pitches are simultaneously bowed and plucked, assign the pizzicato notes opposite stem directions. Use a separate notehead only when the pizzicato note is to be played on a different string from the same bowed pitch (see bar 3, second beat, below).

The technique of left-hand pizzicato is so well established that there is no need to add a pizzicato instruction as well as a plus sign, nor to indicate *arco* for a subsequent bowed note. However, an ordinary right-hand pizzicato should be indicated as normal (last bar):

[musical example]

## Percussive sounds

All percussive sounds may be notated with crossed noteheads and each technique given a verbal instruction above the stave.

When the sounds are to be created on the strings, place crossed notes at open-string pitches:

[musical example]

When an instrument is to be struck other than on the strings, place crossed notes outside the stave (a). Alternatively, one or more lines above the stave may define different areas on the instrument (b). When there are independent lines, rhythms notated with ordinary notes are easiest to read:

[musical example]

(See also Symbols to replace repeated instructions, p. 494.)

## Harmonics

Two types of harmonic (Italian: *armonico* (i), abbrev. *arm.*) can be produced on stringed instruments: natural and artificial. The notation differentiates the two; this is an important distinction for the player, as the sounds are produced in different ways.

### Notation options

The recommended approach is to write harmonics as the player will finger them.

Another approach is to notate all harmonics at sounding pitch with a small circle over each note but without distinguishing between natural and artificial harmonics, leaving the player to find the most convenient or most secure place to sound each note. (This approach is not always appropriate in orchestral music, where, with limited rehearsal, there may not be time to work out how best to finger a passage of harmonics.) A statement should be added if this approach is used, since usually this notation suggests that all harmonics are available as natural harmonics.

### Natural harmonics

The open string is touched lightly to produce a harmonic (also called an 'overtone' or 'partial') at various points ('nodes') along the string.

**Harmonic series for violin and viola G string**

[musical example]

The first ten or twelve harmonics are given for each string in Table 2, opposite. Higher harmonics are available — as can be seen from the example above — but are, generally, impractical to prescribe.

Natural harmonics are written at sounding pitch with a small circle above the note (but see also Alternative notation for harmonics 3-6, p. 416).

Printed music distinguishes the harmonic circle from the open string, which uses a zero:

[musical example]

The harmonic circle goes below the stave if only the lower note of a chord is a harmonic:

[musical example]

Double-stopped harmonics require a circle for both notes:

[musical example]

**TABLE 2: Natural harmonics**

[musical example]

Each repeated harmonic note requires a circle. It is useful to repeat the circle on a tied harmonic — or, in a score, at least as a reminder at the start of a new system — to confirm that the harmonic should not transform into a stopped note.

To cancel the use of a harmonic — i.e. so that the pitch becomes a stopped note — add the verbal instruction *non arm.*:

[musical example]

#### ALTERNATIVE NOTATION FOR HARMONICS 3-6

The second harmonic (the octave) divides the string into equal halves. To write the third to sixth harmonics at pitch implies that they are produced on the upper half of the string, between the octave harmonic and the bridge (see column above halfway point, Table 3). These same harmonics can also be produced on the lower half of the string, between the octave harmonic and the tuning peg (see column below halfway point).

To indicate that harmonics are to be played on the lower part of the string, add a diamond-shaped note at the position where the finger touches the string. The harmonics occur in the following places along the string:

**TABLE 3: Natural harmonics, alternative fingerings**

| violin and viola G string | |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| above halfway point | notated<sup>*</sup> |
| 3rd harmonic | 2/3 of the string |
| 4th harmonic | 3/4 of the string |
| 5th harmonic | 4/5 of the string |
| 6th harmonic | 5/6 of the string |

| below halfway point | notated |
|----------------------|---------|
| 1/3 of the string | [musical example] |
| 1/4 of the string | [musical example] |
| 1/5 of the string<sup>**</sup> | [musical example] |
| 1/6 of the string | [musical example] |

<sup>*</sup> and sounding

<sup>**</sup> This harmonic can also be produced at other points along the string (see Table 4)

**TABLE 4: Natural harmonics, fingerings in lower half of string**

[musical example]

This fingering allows harmonics to be combined with stopped notes in low hand positions (i.e. close to the tuning pegs) without significant shifts.

The diamond remains hollow, regardless of its duration. Where the rhythm is not clear from its context (bar 2, below), differentiate minims and crotchets by writing the rhythmic values as small notes in brackets over the stave.

Always designate the string to be used, since fingering for the same pitch on different strings will result in different harmonics (see also Octave harmonic, p. 419):

[musical example]

An alternative approach is to indicate the open-string pitch of the designated string (as illustrated in the following example). However, this traditional style of notation is more cumbersome to read. If this notation is used, it is very important to differentiate the open-string pitch from an ordinary notehead, as otherwise this notation would be identical to that used for artificial harmonics (see p. 420). Use a small bracketed black notehead (regardless of duration) for the open string and for the first note only of a tied harmonic:

[musical example]

Double-stopped harmonics are clearest to read when the string numbers are given above the stave (a). It is unnecessary to label the lowest two strings, as such double-stops cannot be played in any other way (see (a), third chord).

If open-string notes are used instead of string numbers, give each harmonic a separate stem (b):

[musical example]

A diamond-shaped note does not take a circle above it: circles should be used exclusively for the notation of harmonics at sounding pitch.

Since the fingered note is not the resultant sounding pitch, to avoid confusion it is often advisable to indicate the sounding pitch as well (see Indicating sounding pitches, p. 421).

#### OCTAVE HARMONIC

The octave harmonic, uniquely, has only one fingering: the note is fingered as a stopped note and sounded as a harmonic at the same place on the string.

It is sometimes written as a diamond note where it is useful to match the notation of other harmonics that are played on the lower half of the string. However, since the fingering is the same as the sounding pitch, it is more usual to notate it as an ordinary note:

[musical example]

If the octave harmonic is written as a diamond note for other than the top string, it requires a string designation ('II' in the example below) — otherwise it will be taken to be the natural harmonic played a fourth above the open string on the adjacent higher string:

[musical example]

#### INDICATING MICROTONES

Harmonics other than fifths and octaves deviate in pitch from their equal-tempered counterparts but it is unnecessary to indicate microtone accidentals for them. Furthermore, this information may confuse the player since the pitch of a natural harmonic cannot be modified. Add any relevant microtonal accidentals only when a player should modify the pitch by playing an artificial harmonic (see example Harmonic sounding pitches and clef changes, p. 422).

### Artificial harmonics

The player creates an artificial fundamental by stopping the string at one pitch with the first (index) finger, or the thumb (cello and bass only), and touching the string at a higher interval (the node) with another. This interval can be only as wide as the hand stretch possible on each instrument. The most commonly used artificial harmonic is at the node a fourth above the fundamental:

**TABLE 5: Artificial harmonics**

| interval creating artificial harmonic | sounding above the fundamental | written | sounding |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|----------|
| perfect fourth | 2 octaves | [musical example] | [musical example] |
| perfect fifth | 1 octave and a fifth | [musical example] | [musical example] |
| major third | 2 octaves and a major third | [musical example] | [musical example] |
| minor third* | 2 octaves and a fifth | [musical example] | [musical example] |

*This is a difficult harmonic to sound, particularly on violin and viola

Notate the stopped pitch as an ordinary note, with the touched pitch above it as a diamond note. Both notes must always be on the same stem.

The diamond remains hollow, while the stopped note indicates the duration. Both notes take ties and duration dots:

[musical example]

This fingering does not take a harmonic circle above it: a circle is always reserved for a sounding pitch.

#### DOUBLE-STOPPED HARMONICS

In a double-stop, the fundamental and node (i.e. the two noteheads) for each harmonic must vertically align. It is clearest to use separate stems for each harmonic. Where there are adjacent notes, offset the lower harmonic to the right; if it is essential to have only one stem — e.g. due to lack of space — then both notes of one of the harmonics must move to the wrong side of the stem (this is not recommended):

[musical example]

### Indicating sounding pitches

In a context in which harmonics may be unfamiliar, it is advisable to indicate sounding pitches for any harmonic fingering (natural or artificial) that does not represent actual pitch. This enables players to be sure what pitch is intended: they may choose to play the harmonic in a different position, better suited to a particular instrument. (Double bass players, especially, often prefer to find harmonics on another part of the string.)

Professional players will be familiar with the most commonly used harmonics (both the natural and artificial harmonics at the fourth) and therefore do not require sounding pitches for these to be indicated.

Indicate a sounding pitch as a small notehead in brackets directly above or after the fingered pitches. Do not join a small note to the stem of the harmonic, as it might look as if it is an additional note (a). A harmonic circle over the sounding pitch may be indicated but is not necessary. Where convenient, normal stem direction of beamed groups may be reversed to allow sounding pitches to be placed directly above the harmonics (b):

[musical example]

When there are two parts on one stave (for either one or more players), the sounding pitch for the lower part is offset to the right:

[musical example]

Sounding pitches that require octave signs should be placed after the fingered pitches, so that it is clear that the 8va does not affect the fingerings:

[musical example]

#### CLEF CHANGES

Wherever possible, retain the same clef for both fingered and sounding pitches (see bar 1, below). When the sounding pitch requires a clef change, place a cue-sized clef in brackets together with the sounding pitch. The clef for subsequent notes is not affected (bar 2). A change of clef for a fingered pitch takes an independent clef (bar 3):

[musical example]

Where a passage requires many sounding pitches to be notated, and especially if these require clef changes, they grossly distort the rhythmic spacing and clutter the music. In this instance, transfer sounding pitches to a smaller cue stave above the player's part:

[musical example]

(For styling of a cue stave, see Practical alternatives to technical difficulties, p. 497.)

Alternatively, sounding pitches of recurring harmonics may be illustrated in a footnote, using a cue stave.

Another approach is to shift emphasis to the sounding pitch by including the harmonic finger positions as small bracketed notes below or beside the actual pitches. This approach gives the player the flexibility to find alternative fingerings more easily:

[musical example]

### Double bass harmonics

It is extremely confusing for the player to read the qualifying sounding pitches of harmonics when they are notated at actual pitch (*suono(i) reale(i)* or *s.r.*), although this is seen in many editions. It is recommended that all pitches, including natural harmonics in the treble clef, and the sounding pitches of artificial harmonics, are notated to sound an octave lower than written.

To clarify the octave of sounding pitches, either give an explanatory footnote on the relevant page or attach an '8' to the clef:

[musical example]

Where the 4th string might have an extension mechanism, and natural harmonics use fingering in low hand positions, indicate the pitch of the open string to avoid ambiguity:

[musical example]

### Harmonic glissandos

#### NATURAL HARMONICS
When a finger lightly touches the string, a glissando will pick up the notes of the harmonic series on that string. Indicate the string to be used. As long as the glissando is indicated *harm. gliss.*, interim pitches between the starting and finishing notes need not be specified:

[musical example]

When a glissando is to sound the harmonic pitches in a specific rhythm, notate each harmonic individually:

[musical example]

#### ARTIFICIAL HARMONICS
Add glissando lines between both the fundamental note and the diamond. This indicates that the hand slides along the fingerboard, maintaining the same interval between the fingers:

[musical example]

### Half-stopped harmonics

Reduced left-hand finger pressure at nodal or non-nodal points produces indeterminate sounds predominantly of overtones. This may be notated with a half-filled diamond note, together with a verbal explanation at its first appearance such as *half-stop*, *half-harmonic* or *reduce normal pressure*. Since the symbol is quite hard to read in the stave, it is a good idea to confirm an immediately following ordinary harmonic:

[musical example]

## Scordatura

This is the name given to the practice of re-tuning one or more strings. Indicate the altered open-string pitches at the start of a scordatura passage (see Kurtag extract, opposite).

In a full score, notate scordatura notes at sounding pitch, for convenience. (For clarity, the score should state whether played or sounding pitch is used.)

### PLAYER'S PART

Notate the part at sounding pitch so that the player can see clearly what is intended. When more than one string is re-tuned and thus the fingering becomes complicated, allocate a second stave for the part at transposed (i.e. fingered) pitch (marked *tasto* — 'fingered', below). Place the stave with sounding pitches above the one for fingered pitches. The sounding-pitch stave may be cue-sized, since it is needed only for reference. In the extract below, both violin staves are full size: both the singer (who reads the actual pitches) and the player (who reads the fingered pitches) perform from this score.

In an instrumental part with extended scordatura, consider presenting the two versions (transposed and sounding versions) on facing pages.

A transposed version must clarify which strings the player should use — otherwise there is too much room for confusion:

[musical example]

(The dotted systemic barline between the two versions of the violin part reflects the published score; for recommended style, see Practical alternatives to technical difficulties, p. 497.)

When a glissando is to an unspecified pitch below the bottom open-string pitch, an instruction must indicate that the string is to be de-tuned (see double-bass example under Triangular noteheads, p. 12).

## Technical instructions

### Mutes

Mute instructions are usually given in Italian:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| *con sord.* / *sordina(e)* | with mute(s) |
| *senza sord.* | without mute |
| *via sord.* | remove mute |

Position a mute instruction after player numbers (if these are specified), as the first of any technical instructions, since the player needs time to attach or remove the mute (see Mute instructions, p. 563; for mute instructions on a shared score stave, see Mutes, p. 530).

The instruction *senza sord.* goes before the first unmuted notes. The less commonly used *via sord.* is placed directly after a muted passage and is a useful warning to the player — for instance, if taking off the mute coincides with a page-turn.

### Order of text instructions

Specify player distribution first, so that it is clear how many players (if not all) are affected by the ensuing instructions; playing techniques go afterwards, closest to the relevant notes (see Technical instructions, p. 492).

**TABLE 6: Horizontal arrangement of technical instructions**

| number of players | division method | mute | playing technique | area on string | bowing technique | part of bow | expressive label | string |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| tutti | unis. | con sord. | arco | sul pont. | trem. | alla punta | con/senza vibrato | IV |
| solo(i)/sola(e) | div. | senza sord. | pizz. | sul tasto | sulla corda | al tallone | | sul G |
| | | | col legno | | detaché | tutto l'arco | | |
| | | | | | flautando | | | |
| | | | | | arpeggiando | | | |
| | | | | | spiccato | | | |
| | | | | | jeté | | | |

Mute instructions precede division where no player numbers are given, e.g. *con sord, div. arco.*

(For labelling, see also Divided string ensemble, p. 428.)

### Cancelling instructions

The terms *ord.*, *nat.*, or *norm.* cancel non-standard techniques (see Cancelling instructions, p. 495).

Cancel the following instructions as listed:

| instruction | cancelled by |
|-------------|--------------|
| div. a leggio /divide by desk | *à 2, ord.** / divide by player |
| con sord. | senza sord. |
| snap pizz. / Ф / Ф | pizz. ord.* |
| col legno tratto / battuto | arco ord.* |
| trem. | non trem. |
| arm. | non arm. |
| spiccato / jeté | sulla corda / ord.* |
| alla punta / al tallone | pos. ord.* |
| non vib. /senza vib. | vib. / con vib. /vib. ord. * |

\**ord.* /*nat.* / *norm.*

Techniques that are followed by a dotted line --- for their duration do not require cancelling verbally

### Positioning symbols

Technical instructions go furthest from a note, since it is more important that information as to how the note should sound goes closest to it. Rarely do all the signs below appear at once, but if they do, string numbers and fingering should be displaced to the left where possible, to reduce the stack of symbols (see example under Fingering, p. 396).

Harmonic circles and open-string indications may be fitted inside a slur where they would otherwise appear too far from their notes (see Shostakovich extract, p. 424).

Place symbols in the following order relative to the note:

| furthest from note | | | | | closest to note |
|--------------------|---|---|---|---|----|
| ⊓ and ⋁ | pause | string indication | fingering | open string/harmonic circle | articulation |

The symbols go above the stave, except where there is a lower part with separate stems:

[musical example] 

## Divided string ensemble

### Labelling divisions

Division is indicated *div.* (*divisi*). This divides each member of the string section (1st Violins, 2nd Violins, etc.) into two lines unless there is an instruction to divide into further lines: *div. a 3*, etc.

The 'outside player' at the desk takes the upper note, the 'inside player' the lower note. When there are more than two notes and each note is to be played by a separate player, this division must be indicated (bars 3-4 below).

A move back to two lines from a greater division is indicated *div. a 2* (see bar 5). A return to unison is marked *unis.* (*unisoni*):

[musical example]

(See also Unisons, p. 526.)

### Double-stopping and a divided line

In a full score, it is necessary to distinguish between double-stopping and a divided line since it is acceptable for a divided line in rhythmic unison to have single stems — as in the example above (see also Sharing stems, p. 525).

When two lines on a single stave have double-stops, each line must take separate stems to clarify its pitches (see bar 5, below).

The instruction *non div.* indicates that chords should not be divided between players (see bar 3, below). To indicate that an occasional multiple stop is not divided, place a vertical bracket | beside the chord — usually in front of it (bar 1). The bracket is quicker to read than *non div.* (However, a passage of undivided chords should always take the verbal instruction.) A bracket also shows how a chord containing semibreves or breves divides (bars 6-7):

[musical example]

A vertical bracket also signifies *non arpeggiando* for pizzicato chords (see Notes plucked simultaneously, p. 409; also, Extent of arpeggiation, p. 132). Therefore, to avoid ambiguity, clarify an entry with *non div.* (or *non arpegg.*), if necessary.

### Player allocation

It is usual to prescribe the required number of divisions and leave the players to decide how to distribute the lines. The allocation depends upon the nature of the material (including its difficulty), the number of players available and the acoustic of the hall. Since it is acoustically preferable to disperse a line through a whole section, division into two or four is 'at the desk', i.e. each consecutive player takes the next line. There is no need to indicate this (*div. ord.*) except, conceivably, after a differently prescribed division.

Where there are many different divisions, the players at a single desk take the same line so as not to distract each other. This is prescribed as *divide by desk* (Italian: *div. a leggio*). Such an indication may be given (although it is usually obvious) when it is clear that this is going to be the best way to divide a section.

Divisions other than into two or four (*div. a 3*, *div. a 5*, etc.) are more likely to be by desk than by player — for the same reason.

Half the section (usually allocated to each 'outside' player at the desk) is labelled *half* (Italian: *metà*).

#### PLAYER LABELLING

It must be clear whether a numeral refers to the number of the division, the desk or the player. A specific number of players may be allotted desk or player numbers, e.g. *2 desks* or *4 soli* or *4 players* and *back desk* or *last 2 players*.

Individual desks are labelled *desk 1*, *desk 2*, etc.

Individual players are labelled *solo* or *player*: *1 solo*, *2 solo*, (or *solo 1*, *solo 2*) or *player 1*, *player 2*, etc.

Two or more solo players together are marked *2 soli*, *3 soli*, etc., or *2 players*, *3 players*, etc.

[musical example]

(See also Use of 'solo' and 'soli', p. 495.)

An alternative approach is to label outside-desk players as (a), inside players as (b): thus desk 1's labels would be 1(a) and 1(b). This concise labelling saves space in a large score (see Carter extract, p. 517).

The remaining players of a section are labelled *gli altri* (abbrev. *altri*/*g.a.*) or *the others*.

*Tutti* ('all') indicates that the whole section should play together after one or more players has been silent:

[musical example]

*Unis.* indicates that the whole section should play together after a division of either equal lines or *soli* + *gli altri* (see next example).

Where one or more players has been silent and the rest of the section divided, a return to a single line requires a *tutti* as well as a *unis.* instruction:

[musical example]

In Italian, *viola(e)* is a feminine noun and may take feminine endings if preferred: *sola*, *sole* (pl), *tutte*, *le altre*.

### Combined techniques sharing noteheads

A string part may be divided so that, while players have the same notes, some may use one technique and some another. In a score individual stems indicate this. Label each stem with the required technique so that there is no confusion:

[musical example]

In a player's copy, assign a separate stave for each technique, for the sake of clarity.
