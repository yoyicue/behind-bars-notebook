# 15. Vocal Music

## Clefs

Clefs other than the treble and bass are used only to replicate authentic performing editions of early music or before the opening of a piece as an incipit to show the clef in which the music was originally written (see below).

In all other circumstances, soprano, alto, counter-tenor and tenor voices appear in the treble clef, with the bass voice in the bass clef.

Music for tenor is written in the treble clef sounding an octave lower than written. The clef é is recommended, as this helps to identify the tenor line in choral music.

When a four-part choir is laid out on two staves, the tenor part is written at concert pitch in the bass clef, in order to share a stave with the bass voice (see Two-stave SATB layout, p. 468).

The baritone voice almost always appears in the bass clef, although the treble clef (sounding an octave lower than written, as for the tenor voice) may be used for a solo part with a high tessitura. In choral writing, the treble clef is not recommended, since a chorus-part baritone range should sit comfortably in the bass clef.

### INCIPIT
An incipit (Latin, 'begins') indicates original clef, key signature (if used), time signature, first written note in its original note-value, and, optionally, original rests prior to the first sung note. Each voice part's original designation is also included:

Marenzio: O Rex gloriae

[musical example] 

## Placing dynamics, expression marks and technical instructions

Dynamics, expression marks and verbal instructions go above the stave in order to leave the space below the stave clear for the sung text. This ensures that technical instructions cannot be confused with the text:

[musical example]

(See also Placing dynamics relative to the stave, p. 101; also, Performance instructions, p. 491.)

Note that short crescendos and diminuendos should appear as hairpins, minimizing the amount of verbal information to read (this is especially helpful in choral music).

### ARTICULATION MARKS

Traditionally, printed music placed all articulation marks above the stave, so as to be clear of the text. This is still acceptable practice: it enables the text to be placed as close as possible to the stave, an important consideration if reading an underlying translated text (a). It is equally acceptable (and now common practice) to place articulation next to all noteheads, in order to make it more conspicuous in some contexts (b). However, articulation is best placed above the stave if it would otherwise force the text to be lowered too far below the stave (c):

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

(For layout of more than one text, see Alternative text underlay, p. 449.)

## Beaming

Until well into the twentieth century, a separate tail was used for each syllable in vocal music, and notes within a beat were beamed only to indicate that a syllable took more than one note. In syllabic setting, this notation makes all but the simplest rhythms difficult to read, a problem compounded by the fact that text underlay often distorts note-spacing (see p. 440). Instrumental beaming (i.e. beaming into beats) is now used in vocal music together with syllabic slurs (see below):

[musical example] 

## Syllabic slurs

A slur joins two or more notes sung to a single syllable. This visually confirms the syllabic underlay:

[musical example]

(See also Syllable underlay, p. 439.)

Non-legato singing can be indicated with staccato dots, tenuto lines or accents within the slur:

[musical example]

Omit syllabic slurs where phrasing or rests occur within the span of one syllable, as two sets of slurs are confusing:

[musical example]

A short slur is usually best placed close to the noteheads, regardless of whether articulation appears above or below the stave ((a) and (b)). Where pitches are below the stave, the slur may be best placed above the stave to avoid lowering the text level (c):

[musical example]

Place a long syllabic slur above the stave, so that it is clear of the text (see example Hyphens placed away from noteheads, p. 449).

(See also Syllabic slurs for alternative text, p. 451, and Wordless singing, p. 455.)

## Phrasing and breathing points

Phrase marks are not generally used in vocal music because of the potential confusion with syllabic slurs. It is necessary to indicate phrasing only where phrase length differs from the punctuation of the text or where phonetic sounds replace text (see Changing vowel sounds, p. 452 and Wordless singing, p. 455). If used, phrase marks should be placed above the stave so as to be clear of the text.

A breathing point may either be written into the music as rests, or a breath mark indicated independently. In the latter case, place a tick or comma above each vocal stave, just before a subsequent note or barline. When the time taken to breathe is subtracted from the previous note, mark in a tick '. Placed in brackets, the tick indicates an optional breath ('). When the note should be sung for its full duration, with extra time for the breath, add a comma above the stave — this adds a short pause to the bar in which it occurs.

### INDICATING WHERE NOT TO BREATHE

Place the elision sign across the point at which breathing is prohibited, under the text between the two syllables, or between an extender and the following word:

[musical example]

(See also Syllable elision, p. 446; for Extenders, see p. 447.)

## Placing tuplets

Place tuplet indications above the stave, so that they are well away from the text. The eye also becomes accustomed to looking in one place for certain information:

[musical example]

## Enharmonic spelling

It is extremely important to spell the notes of a vocal line in their proper harmonic context so that the singer can think in terms of the degrees of the scale. In a context without clear tonal reference, spell notes with the most recognizable melodic intervals, using perfect, major and minor intervals wherever possible. This enables the singer to 'hear' these intervals in advance of singing them.

Where there is room, give the relevant enharmonic equivalent-pitch notehead for unavoidable augmented or diminished intervals, so as to convert the interval to a familiar one. Give the enharmonic equivalent for the first note (a), unless the second-note equivalent would provide more familiar spelling (b). To provide a cue-sized note is preferable to the practice of using ties between enharmonically equivalent notes; this notation is off-putting at first sight, as the tie appears to join two different pitches (c):

[musical example]

(See also Note-spelling, p. 85.)

## Text

It is very helpful to precede the music with the author's text, in its original poetic or prose format. This encourages an independent understanding of the text. If appropriate for an appreciation of the whole text, sections of the original not set by the composer may be included in square brackets.

When the text is in an unfamiliar language or dialect, provide a translation alongside the original.

The text source should be credited below the given text and any copyright credit added here. When the text is not presented independently of the music, credit the source on the title page or on the first page of music (see Information on the first page of music, p. 504).

### Presenting the text in the music

Place the text below the vocal line, in roman type. Italic may be used to differentiate sounds that are not part of the literary text, such as mm and ah (see Qualifying text sounds, p. 451; for second languages and refrains, see Alternative text underlay, p. 449).

Use upper- and lower-case letters (never exclusively capitals) exactly as written by the author, including poetic capitalization after line breaks in the text. Punctuation follows the author's original, even when this is contrary to the musical phrasing.

Where a word, phrase or line of text is to be repeated, commas separate the repetitions and the final punctuation comes only at the very end. A repeated section of text starts with a lower-case letter:

so sing it, sing it, sing it!

However, where a whole line is repeated, the initial capitalization for the repetition is optional:

When shall we sing, When shall we sing?

or When shall we sing, when shall we sing?

If a voice enters to take up a text already initiated in another voice part, begin such text with a capital letter only if a capital appears in the original source.

### TEXT SIZE

The text must be at a comfortable size to read easily. Do not reduce its size to accommodate lengthy syllables for short note-values. A good proportion for the height of a lower-case letter (such as 'm') is one stave-space.

### Horizontal underlay

Place a line of text as close as possible to the stave without colliding with the notation. Full stops and hyphens should be sufficiently far from the notes for them not to be mistaken for staccato dots or tenuto lines.

A line of text should be parallel to the stave for the length of the system, and not be placed on different levels to accommodate notes below the stave:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

### Syllable underlay

Divide all words of more than one syllable into separate syllables and separate them by inserting hyphens (see Word division, p. 441). This clarifies which syllable is sung to which note.

Place each syllable exactly under the note to which it is sung. Syllables incorrectly aligned will cause confusion.

#### SINGLE NOTE PER SYLLABLE

Centre each syllable directly under its note. For very long syllables, place only the first two or three letters to the left of the note so that the syllable does not start too far before its sung note. If necessary the text may precede the barline:

[musical example]

#### MORE THAN ONE NOTE PER SYLLABLE (INCLUDING TIED NOTES)

The syllable should be aligned left under the first notehead. This draws the eye to the right — an important consideration, since the singer always needs to be looking forward:

[musical example]

Some editions place all syllables consistently to the left of the note, but, in general, this is not helpful. From time to time there may be an aesthetic case for doing so, in order to align vertically either the same text below different staves or different texts below the same voice part. (However, this style has not been adopted in the relevant sections below — see Alternative text underlay, p. 449, and Two-stave SATB layout, p. 468.)

#### SYLLABLE UNDERLAY WITH GRACE NOTES

The traditional approach is to align the text with the full-sized note (a). However, especially in complex music, it is clearest to align the text exactly where it is to be sung (b):

[musical example]

### Note-spacing and text

Note-spacing is normally governed by placing note-values in relative proportion to one another (see Rhythmic spacing, p. 39). In vocal music, the length of text syllables also determines spacing. Short note-values with lengthy syllables can distort spacing, making rhythms difficult to read. Where possible allow more space for longer durations, to minimise distortion:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

It is not always practical to implement instrumental note-spacing, however. A vocal line can potentially take up far too much room if each note-value is spaced in rhythmic proportion:

instrumental spacing

[musical example] 

## Word division

The general principle is to divide words so as to assist the singer in word recognition: both to understand what the text says, and to pronounce the correct sounds at the correct time. It is essential to divide words according to an accepted convention. Words separated carelessly are difficult to read and may even be mispronounced. It is most important to divide words in a consistent way.

Oxford University Press's Hart's New Rules is a useful guide for the word division of common European languages, and a starting point for division in English. However, as is the case for dictionaries and spell-checkers, such recommendations are not always of most help, since they are intended to produce appropriate line breaks in paragraphs of text. Furthermore, they do not include divisions for polysyllabic short words, since these should not be divided in a paragraph of text.

### English

Extensive guidelines are given below, because, in English, word structure is so diverse and spelling so arbitrary. These guidelines work with divergent pronunciations. In some cases, division conventions vary between different publishers and setters (see Different approaches to word division, p. 444). However, the most important principle is to choose the same conventions for words of similar structure and to use these consistently.

#### SYLLABLE DEFINITION
A syllable includes no more than one vowel sound. Diphthongs (e.g. boy, few) and triphthongs (e.g. fire, tyre) are elided vowels and, for the purposes of word division, are treated as if they were single vowels. Likewise, unstressed obscured vowels are treated as an elision (e.g. na-tion, tower).

The core sonority of syllables that have no vowels at all, such as the n't sound in wouldn't or the -tle sound in lit-tle, is called a syllabic consonant.

#### COMPOUND WORDS

Divide compound words — i.e. words made up of two (or more) shorter words — into their component parts:

boy-hood, moon-light, out-wards 

#### PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES

Divide off prefixes and suffixes (these comprise a verbal element that is attached to a stem to form a new word):

Prefixes include: a-, ab-, ad-, be-, com-, con-, con-tra-, coun-ter-, de-, dis-, en-, ex-, for(e)-, il-, im-, in-, ir-, mis-, non-, out-, o-ver-, per-, post-, pre-, pro-, re-, sub-, sur-, sym-, trans-, un-, un-der-.

Suffixes include: -a-ble, -age, -al, -ant, -ate, -a-tion, -dom, -ed, -eer, -en, -ent, -er, -e-ry, -'s, -ese, -ess, -'st, ful, -ful, -ian, -i-ble, -ic, -i-fy, -ing, -ion, -ise, -ish, -i-sm, -ist, -i-ty, -ive, -ize, -less, -ling, -ly, -ment, -ness, -or, -ous, -ship, -tion, -ure, -ward(s), -wise, -y.

count-er-act, free-dom, in-ex-plic-a-ble, un-err-ing, writ-er

Exceptions: When adding a suffix to a stem causes the preceding consonant to double, divide between the doubled consonant:

big-gest, glad-den, run-ner, set-ting

(If the last letter of the stem is a double one, divide before the suffix: call-ing, guess-es, stiff-est.)

Be careful not to divide off letter combinations that are not actually prefixes or suffixes. Avoid: gath-er, mis-ter or mist-er, oth-er, ver-y.

(For further exceptions, see Other polysyllables: Softened consonants and Syllabic consonants: Exception, opposite; see also Different approaches to word division, p. 444.)

#### OTHER POLYSYLLABLES

Divide up any polysyllabic units that remain after the steps above. Carry over all consonants, provided that this results in the second syllable starting with a combination of letters that could begin an English word:

mi-stress, ma-ster, o-ther, sa-cred, ve-ry

Divide between consonants that could not start an English word and carry over the remaining consonants that could (this usually equates to dividing between consonants that are articulated separately):

al-ways, an-swer, chil-dren, in-stru-ment, mon-ster, ob-scure, twen-ty

Do not divide two consonants that form a single sound (compare sign-ing and sig-nal):

al-pha, a-wry, cough-ing, doubt-ed, e-cho, high-ly, mer-chant, mo-ther, no-thing 

A doubled consonant between two vowels is normally divided:

hel-lo, let-ter, pop-py, ter-ri-fy, val-ley

(but see also Prefixes and suffixes: Exceptions, p. 442).

Do not break the combination ck. It should always end a syllable:

brack-en, fick-le

Softened consonants: Some consonants (usually c, g, s and t) soften their sound when certain vowels follow them. Carry over the consonant to the second syllable for this group (le-gend, mea-sure). This group includes taking over a consonant to a suffix that starts with a vowel:

dan-cer, gra-ces, sli-cing, ed-ges, sta-ging, ve-sti-gial, re-ven-ging, vi-sion, ac-tion, crea-ture

When consonants modify preceding vowels in exceptional ways, they should not be separated from them (laugh-ter, plough-ing). This group includes w and y when they represent the second part of a diphthong:

flow-er, stew-ard, voy-age

#### SYLLABIC CONSONANTS

Syllabic consonants have a singable consonant (usually the sounds l, m, n and r). Divide the text for them:

ac-re, could-n't, pri-son

Syllabic consonants ending in a consonant + le are divided as if they ended -el instead of -le:

bu-gle, cir-cle, lit-tle, mu-scle, peo-ple, trou-ble, twin-kle, whi-stle, wrig-gle

Exception: A suffix added to a root that ends in a syllabic consonant is a special case. Attach the syllabic consonant to the suffix, since they now become one sound:

bu-gler, cir-cling, whi-stled, wrig-gling

For any case not covered above, divide so as to be of greatest help to the singer. Sometimes bold solutions may be called for, as in the case of the word freer (i.e. 'more free') when set as two syllables; the root is free, to which the suffix -er has been added, though the third e has been suppressed; so the most helpful way to indicate this is as free-(e)r or free-er.

#### DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO WORD DIVISION

The singer's first priority is word recognition. Usually, dividing compound words into their component parts will help fast word recognition. However, in English it is never going to be possible to divide all words so that they look as they will sound. When the following syllables (divided according to the guidelines above) are separated by a page or line break, a sight-reader may well mispronounce them:

a-ny, ear-ly, flow-er, hop-ing, mak-ing, ma-ny, no-thing, thou-sand, wea-ry

The singer's other priority is to place vowels and consonants exactly where marked. The eye moves forward and the singer does not want to look back for the text. For this purpose, it is most helpful to place consonants at the beginning of a syllable. Thus some setters over-rule suffix separation by carrying over a consonant to a suffix that begins with a vowel. The setter must decide if the breaks that may result are helpful or whether the decreased word recognition may cause the singer to falter:

bra-vest, ho-ping, la-sting, re-vea-ling, wee-ping

(See also Qualifying text sounds, p. 451.)

While it is possible to divide syllables to indicate the quality of a consonant (as in Other polysyllables: Softened consonants, p. 443), it is much harder to do so for vowels. Some setters do divide selected words in such a way as to show the vowel sound. This involves attaching the consonant to the preceding syllable to suggest a short vowel: ev-er, nev-er, and taking over the consonant to suggest a long vowel: o-ver, e-ven. Thus some words containing suffixes will take over the consonant: ri-sing, fi-nest; others (sometimes of the same root) will keep suffix separation: ris-en, fin-ish. The setter must judge whether it is distracting to divide words in different ways. A decision may depend on context: decisions on an individual basis might work for a short work but be distracting to carry through on a large scale.

### Latin

For the purposes of singing, divide words so as to be of most help to the singer. Grammarians recommend dividing compound words into their component parts, separating off prefixes and suffixes. However, setters frequently overrule this division, in order to place consonants where they will be sung.

The following guidelines can be followed without any particular grammatical knowledge of the language.

Divide one vowel from another:

di-es, cre-at, tu-us

unless the pair forms a diphthong. The Latin diphthongs should not be divided: ae, au, ei, eu and oe.

ae-ter-na, coe-li, gau-de

Carry over a single consonant:

a-mo-re, a-qua, do-mi-nus, lau-da-te, pro-xi-mus

This includes the consonantal i (really a j) as in e-ius, cu-ius, in-iu-ri-a (otherwise spelled e-jus, cu-jus, in-ju-ri-a).

An exception may be made for prefixes that end in a consonant. It may be deemed more helpful to see these prefixes unseparated in order to keep a clearer structure for the word:

ad-e-a-mus, ex-au-di-o, ob-e-o, sub-ve-ne-re, trans-ab-e-o (not tran-sa-be-o)

(When a prefix ends in a vowel, it would normally be separated as a matter of course by following the other guidelines given.)

#### CONSONANT GROUPS

Divide a double consonant:

an-nus, il-la, mis-si-o, ter-ra

Do not divide consonants that form a single sound. Carry over both. This group includes all consonant + l or r combinations, which should be attached to the following vowel:

a-scen-do, con-fla-gro, la-cri-ma, pa-tris

For other combinations, practice varies regarding the division of two or more consonants. Sometimes there are two equally valid divisions (but these should not be mixed).

It is often helpful to divide between consonants that form separate sounds: l, m, n and r are almost always divided from a following consonant (mm is an exception — see first example, p. 446):

an-ge-lus, at-que, in-ter, mun-do, par-te, pul-cra, sal-ve, sem-per, ver-bum

The nature of the setting may dictate division in other consonant groups. It is recommended that if consonants are sung together, they are placed together. Carry over as many consonants as possible to the beginning of a syllable. Thus they appear exactly where the singer will place them. This is helpful in a melismatic setting, i.e. where syllables may be spread over a system or page break:

fa-ctus, ho-ste, i-pse, ma-gnus, no-strum, o-mnis, pro-pter, san-ctus

The other option is to carry over fewer consonants, dividing between two when there are only two. In syllabic setting (e.g. one syllable to one note) the separated syllables will be close together on the page and the singer can usually see the entire word in a glance:

fac-tus, hos-te, ip-se, mag-nus, nos-trum, om-nis, prop-ter, sanc-tus

The likely pronunciation might even be a factor; for instance, ag-nus, ig-ne (with a hard g — two separate sounds — in German Latin) or a-gnus, i-gne (with a modified n sound in Italian Latin).

Avoid fact-us, magn-us, omn-is, sanct-us (or sa-nctus): these divisions do not help the singer to place the consonants correctly.

## Syllable elision

Especially in older music, an apostrophe replaces a vowel that has the potential to elicit a separate syllable (e.g. called written as call'd in order not to be interpreted as call-èd). This practice clarifies the intended result.

Divide the word according to normal rules: carry over consonants as if the replaced vowel were present. Thus the consonants of the two syllables are placed together, i.e. where they will be elided:

[musical example]

An elision sign (like a small tie) is placed beneath the text to indicate where two (or even three) syllables are to be elided (a). The slur is unnecessary for elision within a single word — as long as hyphenation is correct, the elision is obvious (b):

[musical example]

Always use a hyphen to separate syllables that could otherwise be elided:

[musical example] 

## Extenders

An extender, a line of stave-line thickness, follows a final syllable or monosyllabic word that extends beyond one written note, including a tied note.

The line extends to the last written note, but not to the end of the duration. Any punctuation goes at the end of the word, before the extender:

[musical example]

Place the extender on a level with the base of the text; it should not be centred like a hyphen (see Hyphens, p. 448).

When there is a change of key or time signature at the end of a system, the extender stops with the barline (see following example).

If an extender starts at the very end of a system, allow extra space before the barline so that there is room to place the beginning of the extender at the end of the word.

At the beginning of a system, the extender starts just before the first note, together with the slur or tie:

[musical example]

No extender is needed where a syllable occupies the length of its written duration nor where a single syllable is sung to one note alone:

Purcell: Come, ye Sons of Art

[musical example]

Where there are short rests within the span of a single syllable, continue the extender uninterrupted under the rests until the last written duration of the syllable: see example Syllable spanning rests, p. 435. Where there are longer rests, discontinue the extender and reiterate the word or syllable in brackets (the brackets indicate that the text is not reiterated afresh):

[musical example]

## Hyphens

The hyphen is a short line centred between two syllables. Its purpose is to indicate that the two syllables surrounding it are part of the same word. A hyphen should be placed midway between the base and top of a lower-case letter, and not at the base of the text, where it will be mistaken for an extender. Never use an extender between syllables — an extender indicates that a word has ended and its incorrect use will cause confusion:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example] 

A word divided over a system break takes a hyphen at the end of the first system. When the syllable is completed on the first note of the new system, it is clearest to add another hyphen (although some editions omit this). When the next syllable comes later than the first note of the system, add hyphens:

[musical example]

Note that when there is a change of key signature or time signature at the end of the system, the hyphens should stop short of the barline.

### OMITTING HYPHENS

It is acceptable to omit a hyphen between a two-syllable word to save space, provided that the word cannot be elided into a single syllable in error (see Syllable elision, p. 446). However, hyphens always clarify text underlay. It is essential to divide words of more than two syllables with hyphens:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

### HYPHEN SPACING

Place hyphens at regular intervals between widely spaced syllables (avoid positioning a hyphen directly below a note, since it may look like a tenuto line):

[musical example]

Where a divided word spans rests, place hyphens before and after rests but not through long periods of rests:

[musical example]

When one syllable of a multisyllabic word spans several rests, repeat the syllable in brackets after each rest period, matching the notation given to an extender that spans rests (see last example under Extenders, p. 447).

## Alternative text underlay

In verse format, all verses can be underlaid below a vocal line as long as there is only the occasional rhythmic deviation from the first verse. If verses have more than the occasional rhythmic differences, set out each verse separately where space allows, to avoid too much complexity. It is possible to accommodate one alternative rhythm on the same stave. A third alternative requires an additional cue-sized stave.

When a second language is used, the language given first depends on the purpose of the edition. Present the original (or preferred) language in roman type closest to the stave, with the second language beneath in italic. A third language would be in roman type.

Text for a refrain in a single-language edition may take italic type.

### ALTERNATIVE RHYTHMS

The first verse or the first language (the principal text) takes ordinary stem directions. The alternative rhythm takes cue-sized notes with opposite stem directions. Both rhythms share full-sized noteheads except when one part is dotted. Place the alternative rhythms after the main note, except when it is the main note that has the dot. Both rhythms share a notehead even when one part is tied, although the alternative rhythm requires its own cue-sized stems (fourth example — see also Different numbers of syllables, p. 450):

[musical example]

It is also acceptable to use up-stems for all principal-text rhythms, and down-stems for all alternative rhythms. This style may be more straightforward to the eye, should flipping stems be too distracting. (Examples (a) and (b) in the section Different numbers of syllables, below, use this style for comparison purposes.)

Tuplets: When a tuplet sign refers to both rhythms, place its indication above the stave, as is normal in vocal music (a). When only one of the two rhythms is a tuplet, the indication must go to the stem side of the rhythm (b):

[musical example]

#### RESTS

Where rests occur, both parts must have complete bar lengths. The alternative rhythm takes cue-sized rests:

[musical example]

#### DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF SYLLABLES
Some editions use a simple system: all rhythms that are required by one or other of the texts take full-sized notes; dotted ties and dotted slurs are used for all instances where a tie or slur does not apply to all verses or languages. The resulting notation is as in example (c) opposite.

However, most editions give priority to the principal text in the following ways.

Where the alternative text has a greater number of syllables, the alternative line takes extra note-values — all down-stems in the following example (a). This includes situations where the principal part is tied (b):

[musical example]

Where the alternative text has fewer syllables, there are two possible layouts.

One style (particularly suited to simple rhythms) is to use a dotted tie to show elided notes in the alternative rhythm. This may be the easiest notation to read, except that dotted ties mid-stave lose some legibility (c). The other style is to use extra note-values for the alternative text (d):

[musical example]

### SYLLABIC SLURS FOR ALTERNATIVE TEXT
When the principal text requires a syllabic slur, use a solid slur. Slurs exclusively for the alternative text are dotted. The shorter of two slurs goes closest to the notes (a). As with the notation of different numbers of syllables (above), some (especially older) editions use two parts rather than dotted slurs — this is not necessary as it adds extra information to the stave (b):

[musical example] 

## Qualifying text sounds

A pronunciation guide is necessary for text in an obscure language or dialect, or to define text sounds of a transliteration or a non-syntactical (or 'nonsense') text. Pronunciation may be notated using the International Phonetic Alphabet, as given in a standard dictionary. Most professional singers are familiar with this (see extract from Ligeti's Aventures, p. 459).

Alternatively, qualify the sounds according to a familiar language. Indicate in the preface some reference system, e.g.:

The following sounds are pronounced:
ʌ as in the English cut
Ch as in the Scottish loch

This second method of description is appropriate for amateur singers, who may be unfamiliar with the International Phonetic Alphabet.

When the syllables of a word are divided between different voice parts and the complete word is not obvious, qualify the sound of an isolated syllable by providing the whole word in a footnote. This ensures correct pronunciation:

[musical example]

* no as in nothing
* om as in trouble

Text sounds without linguistic meaning (referred to below as phonemes) that are independent of surrounding text may be isolated in italic, where necessary, to avoid confusion with the text (see example (b) under Humming, p. 455). However, many editions do not make this text-style differentiation, preferring to reserve italic for expression marks. The phonetic letters may be placed in square brackets instead:

[musical example]

After a page-turn, it is useful to confirm the syllable of a long melisma by repeating it in round brackets. The brackets indicate that the syllable is not reiterated afresh. This helps the singer to maintain the quality of the vowel:

[musical example]

### Changing vowel sounds

The notation below requires verbal definition at the front of a score or in a footnote at its first appearance.

To indicate a gradual change of vowel, place an arrow between vowels. The arrow also shows the length of the transition between one vowel and the next (and replaces an extender).

Each note of unchanged pitch may be tied, to indicate that there is no separate articulation even though there is a vowel change. (This exceptional use of ties between changing text sounds applies to the following two examples and the first two under Sustaining consonant sounds, pp. 453-4, as well.)

Syllabic slurs have been omitted from the following example to avoid confusion. They have been replaced by phrase marks, more helpful in the present context:

[musical example]

A short elision sign may be used to alert the singer to the sudden change, i.e. after a gradual transition:

[musical example] 

### Placing consonants

#### FINAL CONSONANTS

To indicate an emphatic final consonant, place an articulation mark (staccato dot or wedge, or accent) on the final note. It is unnecessary to separate the final consonant from the rest of the word and to write it at the end of the duration, where the singer will place it anyway. Single-syllable words will become distorted when divided up, which is particularly unhelpful:

[musical example] 

#### SUSTAINING CONSONANT SOUNDS

The dividing of a single syllable instructs the singer to sing on the separated consonants. It is often clearest to notate the whole syllable first, so that the word is immediately intelligible, then to add the consonants in round brackets where they are to be placed. The brackets clarify that the consonants are not articulated in addition to the whole syllable, as do ties between held pitches (see (a) below).

When the consonant sound has more than one pitch, use separate syllabic slurs to clarify the duration of the sustained consonant; a second set of slurs indicates that there is no break in sound from the previous vowel and makes it easier to see the whole syllable (b):

[musical example] 

Without brackets, each written consonant sound is separately articulated.

It is equally acceptable merely to divide the word according to how it will be sung — although sometimes the text is then less recognizable at first glance. When consonants are repeated, this method is simplest. Each repeated articulation requires a repetition of the consonant (or vowel) — see last bar:

[musical example]

For immediate transition to a sustained consonant, underline the consonant; this notation requires verbal clarification in a footnote, such as 'close onto final consonants immediately' (a). Alternatively, place the consonant in brackets after the syllable (b). This latter notation is especially useful when the consonant is not the final letter of the word:

[musical example] 

### Repeated text sounds

#### FREELY REPEATED TEXT

Text to be repeated freely may be followed by a repeat-bar sign or enclosed in repeat barlines:

[musical example]

For unmeasured chanting on a monotone, notate a single note-value for the duration of the chanting. Place all the text below. It is usual to extend the bar length to accommodate the extent of the text, but where this is impractical, block it onto more than one line.

#### REPEATED PHONEMES

Repeated phonemes or fragmented syllables may take unconventional treatment. Enclose them in repeat barlines:

[musical example]

When syllables are recognizably part of the setting, repeated text should be written out in full (see Presenting the text in the music, p. 438).

### Speaking voice

Cross through note-stems to indicate Sprechstimme (spoken voice on a pitch) by using an oblique stroke or inverted fermata. It is most common to indicate Sprechstimme with a cross on the stem; the indications shown below all have the same meaning. (Performance indications in each case are likely to be Sprechstimme, Sprechgesang, parlando, or similar — depending on the style of delivery required.)

Where there are many adjacent notes that take Sprechstimme, one might consider joining the stems with a beam across them (with cross added), rather than marking each in turn. Cross through each independent crotchet (quarter-note):

[musical example]

Notate speech on a stave without a clef. A rhythmic stave uses one line; a non-rhythmic stave has no line:

[musical example]

For speech at approximate pitches, give up and down indications; the singer may approximate these contours on any comfortable register:

[musical example]

To indicate unpitched speaking voice, use crossed noteheads or oblique crosses as noteheads ([musical example]). Oblique crosses on a single line ([musical example]) or floating at relative pitch without a stave ([musical example]) may also indicate rhythmic speech.

### Humming

Indicate a humming sound with the phoneme 'hm', 'm' or 'n' (according to preference), or with a simple bracket in place of text (a). It is clearer to use a phoneme when one or more parts retain text (b):

[musical example]

### Tongue clicks

Use a cross (x) as a notehead. The stave indicates approximate pitch.

To notate clicks by themselves, use a stave with a clef (a) or without a clef (b); for clicks that are part of song, cross through noteheads on a stave with clef (c):

[musical example] 

### Wordless singing

Replace text with a sound that can be sustained wordlessly, such as 'ah'. This phoneme may be placed under a vocal line for a melismatic passage or used where there is otherwise no text:

[musical example]

Where there is plenty of room, place a slur at a higher position than for a syllabic slur, to show that the 'ah' sound is continued; this avoids giving the impression that the sound should be reiterated:

[musical example] 

Use 'boc.' for bocca chiusa ('closed-mouth'; singing with the mouth closed) and 'v.' for vocalise (wordless singing on 'ah' or any other phoneme).

To aid readability when all voice parts appear on separate staves, it is a good convention to notate with a single tail any syllable that appears directly under a note. Draw beams between notes when a phoneme is sung on a number of pitches:

[musical example]

As with placing a syllable under its first note (see More than one note per syllable, opposite), the convention above helps identify which notes are sung to phonemes.

### Improvisation

Several notations indicating various degrees of structured improvisation may be based on the given material. The style of improvisation may be defined in a verbal instruction. Repeated notes and beamed repeated rests are both used to indicate the duration of the improvisation. Stems with no noteheads indicate rhythmic ostinati with improvised pitches:

[musical example]

Arrows on stems indicate direction of inflection. A wavy line indicates an improvised melisma. A succession of noteheads and x-noteheads requires improvisation on the written rhythm:

[musical example]

## Choral layouts

### Full choral score

Vocal scoring for any number of parts sets Soprano, Alto (Counter-tenor), Tenor and Bass from top to bottom of the score (a). Each choir or vocal group appears as a unit from high to low voice, according to this order. When an identical text is shared by all parts, centre it between their staves:

[musical example]

Keyboard reduction or figured bass is generally indicated between the two lowest staves. When additional instruments are used (as in oratorio), these come at the top of the score (b), with continuo accompaniment at the bottom of the page.

Identify each vocal part by voice-type at the start of each stave, rather than by singer's name (the exception is for opera extracts, where individual soloists may be identified). Place the voice part in the margin, aligned with the top of the stave, with an abbreviation at the beginning of each system (see Solo vocal and choral abbreviations, p. 474).

### Two-stave SATB layout

A four-part choir is frequently notated on two staves. The soprano and alto or counter-tenor parts share the upper stave, the tenor and bass parts share the lower stave:

[musical example]

Join parts with shared stems when both have the same rhythm, even if they join notes on different pitches. Follow standard practice for note direction on the stave (stems-up for notes above the middle line, stems-down for notes on or below it).

In an SATB two-stave layout, the soprano and tenor parts take up-stems, the alto and bass take down-stems. The stem directions are determined by the different voice types and not by contour. The horizontal placement of notes within a chord should also be governed by voice type: the short-stemmed notes (alto and tenor) are placed first, and the other notes (soprano and bass) aligned with them and not with one another. This ensures clear layout of inner parts and avoids unwanted dissonant intervals between 'neighbouring' notes.

Since the visual alignment is for note stems of the alto and tenor, different note-values may not always share a common stem, despite both parts sharing the same rhythm. However, make sure the up-stem parts have identical beams and flags, as should the down-stem parts, to guarantee readable notation.

#### NOTE PLACEMENT

In an SATB two-stave layout, double note-values with a stem in each direction to indicate unison between pairs of voices (a). Use vertical alignment to differentiate unison between the top and bottom voice of the same stave (i.e. soprano and alto) from unison between voices of different staves (i.e. alto and tenor). Use the alignment with caution, since displacement is required in some situations in order to avoid a collision (b). For unison between all four parts, add a double stem to each stave (c). The double stem below also prevents any misreading due to visual alignment (d):

[musical example]

#### SYLLABIC SLURS AND TEXT PLACEMENT

In a two-stave SATB layout, place slurs above the stave for up-stemmed notes (soprano and tenor) and below the stave for down-stemmed notes (alto and bass). Similarly, in the space between both staves, slurs below a note belong to the parts on the upper stave; slurs above a note belong to the parts on the lower stave. When a syllable is sustained longer by one part, the syllabic slur extends only for that voice part:

[musical example]

Place the text of the soprano and alto (or any other higher pair of parts sharing the upper stave) below the upper stave. The text of the tenor and bass (or any other lower pair of parts sharing the lower stave) should go below the lower stave. Place identical syllables on the same vertical alignment:

[musical example]

#### DIVIDING SOPRANO AND ALTO (OR TENOR AND BASS)

Division within the same voice-type (soprano or alto) normally shares one stem direction. For example, divided S1 and S2 should both have up-stems, as should divided T1 and T2; divided A1 and A2 should have down-stems, as should divided B1 and B2. If this causes confusion, include a cued stave:

[musical example]

#### DIVISION FOR DIFFERENT VOICE PARTS

When a two-stave layout includes dividing parts, as in SSAATTBB, additional cued staves may be preferable. If this is not possible, stem direction may be determined by pitch:

[musical example]

### Unison singing and dividing voice-parts

#### UNISON PARTS

When two or more voice-parts have unison pitches and rhythms with identical text, the conventional practice in older scores is to write unison on the first shared stave (i.e. the upper one), leaving the other stave(s) blank, or with a short vertical line to show a rest. However, this notation may cause confusion, requiring the singers with blank staves to check carefully and remember where they enter. It is more helpful to use the clear system of notating the unison on each relevant stave (as is done for instrumental parts sharing the same pitch) and joining it with a bracket in the margin:

[musical example]

Place the bracket after the vocal abbreviation in the margin. Attach the bracket to the stave(s) (to the upper stave for a two-stave layout), using a solid thin line at right-angles, ending with an arrowhead a comfortable distance from the stave(s). If there are more than two voice-parts in unison, specify the parts that share the unison (e.g. S + B or A + T, etc.).

#### DIVIDING PARTS

When a single part divides in an SATB choir, indicate this with *div.* (*divisi*) (a). When a particular division of two or three is maintained for some length, specify the number of parts (e.g. *div. a 3*) to avoid questions about the desired division (b):

[musical example]

Some choral works have multiple divisions of each voice type. Each voice-type can be split into consistent groupings (e.g. S 1 & 2; A 1 & 2, etc.). Alternatively, each voice-part can take a number (e.g. S 1, 2 & 3; A 1, 2, 3, & 4). Another common practice is to number each voice type from highest to lowest (rather than grouping them):

[musical example]

### Solo vocal and choral abbreviations

For more than one solo voice of the same type in an ensemble or dramatic work, add numbers (S1, S2) or character names (after the voice type: S (Mother), S (Girl)). This is especially important for vocal extracts with action. Identify semi-chorus (*soli*) or small chorus.

Use initial capitals for the abbreviation in the margin of the first page of score, before the first stave of the work. For subsequent appearances use lower-case abbreviations. Use the following abbreviations for vocal parts:

**TABLE 32: Vocal part abbreviations**
| Voice type | First appearance | Subsequent systems |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Bass-Baritone | BB (or B-Bar.) | bb (or b-bar.) |
| Baritone | Bar. | bar. |
| Bass | B | b |
| Chorus | Chorus | chorus |
| Contralto/Alto | A | a |
| Counter-tenor | Ct | ct |
| Mezzo-soprano | Mez. | mez. |
| Reciting voice | Solo | solo |
| Semi-chorus | Semi-ch. | semi-ch. |
| Small chorus | Small ch. | small ch. |
| Soprano | S | s |
| Speaker | Spkr | spkr |
| Tenor | T | t |

### Solo vocal score

A solo vocal part is placed between the right and left hands of a keyboard accompaniment. The voice part should be on a system (set of joined staves) with the accompaniment, and not floating independently. For multiple solo voices, each voice appears on its own stave, the highest at the top. (For exception, see Three-stave scoring, p. 477.) Piano reduction (accompaniment for rehearsal purposes) may add the lower instruments' pitches to the piano bass clef (in preference to using more staves).

All the singer's text is placed below his or her stave only, even when this means duplicating the text for a duet (to avoid the lack of clarity in example (b)). The singer's stave needs to be a good distance from the piano's bass stave, so as to accommodate the sung text easily; the piano's treble and bass staves can be closer together:

[musical example]

#### THREE-STAVE SCORING

Setting a duet on one stave has the advantage of setting the two voices against each other so that the relationship between parts is immediately clear. However, when melodies cross frequently, separate staves are advised. Two voices and piano can use three staves in a system. The voice parts appear between the piano right and left hands, the higher voice placed above the lower (a).

In a choral part, tenor and bass voices may share a middle stave, each part taking a separate stem direction (b). (See also Two-stave SATB layout, p. 468.)

[musical example]

### Choral parts

Voice parts for a section of a chorus follow exactly the score layout. This is essential for rehearsal, enabling the conductor to co-ordinate the parts, and also giving the singers the full musical context.

For some choral works, a separately printed piano score may be made available for practice purposes. This is called the 'vocal score'. In this context, the term 'full score' is used for the conductor's score, which includes all the vocal and orchestral lines.

For some short choral works (such as church anthems), an independent piano part may be published in addition to a simple reduction of the vocal parts, to enable the accompanist to rehearse the singers more effectively.

## Performance instructions

Expressive wordings, such as 'dolce', 'cantabile', should appear in roman type in the music. This differentiates them from text to be sung (which is in roman) and text sounds (which can take italic with square brackets — see Qualifying text sounds, p. 451):

[musical example]

It is redundant to place expression marks both above and below the text. For technical instructions (breathing, etc.), see Placing dynamics, expression marks and technical instructions, p. 434 and the relevant section in Part III.

### Text typefaces in the music

The text to be sung is in roman type.

Expression marks in music to be sung (such as *espressivo*) are also in roman type.

*Phonemes* (i.e. musical sounds without literary context) are in italics.

Note that in multiple-language editions (see Alternative text underlay, p. 449), the main language is in roman, the secondary language is in italic, and the third is in roman (if present).
