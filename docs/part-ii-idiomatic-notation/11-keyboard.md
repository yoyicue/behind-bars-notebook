# 11. Keyboard

## GENERAL TOPICS

### The system and Clefs

Music for keyboard is written on two or more staves joined by a curly brace.
The two staves together are called a braced part or system.

Although the upper stave usually takes the treble clef and the lower stave
the bass clef, each stave can appear in either clef as required (see Changing
clef, p. 7).

(See also Spacing a braced part, p. 488.)

### Distributing notes between the hands

#### Principles

The overriding principle of keyboard notation is to indicate how a player
should distribute the notes between the hands. The positioning of notes on
one or other of the two staves shows this. Notes should not merely be placed
on the treble or the bass stave according to their pitch if this does not
represent a feasible hand distribution:

[musical example]

It is important to show how the hands of the player move, even if this
appears less straightforward for the score-reader. A practical solution to
hand distribution will almost always be helpful, especially for immediate
reading, even if the player subsequently changes it:

[musical example]

Sometimes, precise choreography of the hands becomes so complicated that
it obscures the musical shape. This makes the music more difficult to learn:

Webern: Variations for piano

[musical example]

There are a number of acceptable ways of indicating the distribution of notes
between hands. These are shown below. Aim to keep to one suitable layout
for a piece wherever possible.

#### Allocating one stave per hand

The most usual keyboard layout is to allocate right-hand pitches to the upper
stave, and left-hand pitches to the lower stave. Allocate separate stems for
each hand. (It is not standard practice to use a common stem to indicate both
hands playing at the same time — but see Both hands playing simultaneously,
p. 317.) Both hands may use ledger lines between the staves:

[musical example]

If necessary, clef changes may replace ledger lines to make notes easier to
read. (However, it is better to retain the occasional ledger line so as to keep
clef changes to a minimum.) Clef changes can obscure pitch relationships,
but this is frequently inevitable in keyboard music:

[musical example]

### Hands moving to the opposite stave

#### STEM DIRECTION INDICATING HAND ALLOCATION

If each hand requires only single stems, it is possible to show the contour of
pitches by placing notes on either the treble or the bass clef stave according
to their range. (This avoids the clef changes of the notation above.) When
both hands play on the same stave, stem direction indicates hand allocation:
the right hand takes up-stems; the left hand takes down-stems. Do not allocate rests to the empty stave, since this would imply that a hand is resting:

[musical example]

To avoid ledger lines in the middle of the system, a stem may extend from
one stave to the other to take advantage of the other clef. This notation can
look confusing for more than the occasional chord:

[musical example]

#### BRACKET OR VERBAL INSTRUCTION INDICATING HAND ALLOCATION

In contrapuntal writing, it may be necessary to keep voices on separate
staves to clarify part-writing, rather than to transfer every note to the stave
of the appointed hand. A verbal instruction may indicate that notes are to be
taken with the other hand:

English | R.H. /r.h. | L.H. /l.h.
or | | 
Italian | m.d. (mano destra) | m.s. (mano sinistra)

(See example (d) under Voice-leading between staves, p. 307.)

Alternatively, such notes may be shown with an incomplete bracket, extending vertically from the notehead upwards for right-hand notes, downwards
for left-hand notes (see following example (a)).

An arpeggiated chord that is wider than the spread of both hands may use a
square bracket to encompass the notes of each hand (b):

[musical example]

To show that hands should revert to the original arrangement, provide a further verbal instruction or bracket (see examples (c) and (d) opposite).

#### CROSSING HANDS
When one hand crosses the other, notes of the crossing hand may be written
on the stave of the other hand. As long as there is one stem direction only on
the stave to which the crossing hand is moving, notes may be taken over onto
this stave. This clarifies the contour of the pitches, but at the expense of
showing the hand distribution.

Reverse the stem direction of both hands away from each other on either
stave for the relevant section: the right hand takes down-stems, the left hand
up-stems. For clarity, label the crossing hand beside the first stem. Any rests
for the crossing hand (e.g. the time to allow the hand to change register) are
placed on the same stave as neighbouring notes that make up the beat or bar.
Do not add rests to the vacated stave:

[musical example]

When it is more important to show hand distribution than pitch contour, the
hand that crosses the other remains on its own stave. This layout is essential
if there are already two stem directions on the stave. Indicate how the hands
cross by adding sopra ('above') when the hand in question goes over the
other, sotto ('below') when the hand goes under:

[musical example]

### Voice-leading between staves

A middle part may move between staves according to which hand plays it.
Its stems point into the centre of the system. A diagonal line may trace the
progression between staves (see (a) below). A dotted line is most conspicuous: a solid line can look like a glissando, particularly if the line appears to
connect two noteheads.

The clearest way to indicate the progression of a part between staves is to use
double-stemmed beams where possible (b) (see also p. 315). If there is not
room to move the middle part to the other stave (this already being occupied
by double stems), indicate hand allocation with a vertical bracket (c) or verbal instruction (d):

[musical example]

### Unisons

#### Sharing noteheads in unison

It is an accepted keyboard (and harp) convention that notes of unequal duration may share a notehead in the context of repeated patterns. The shared
notehead saves space, especially when one or both parts has dotted notes. A
minim can double as a beamed note. A dotted note and a note without a dot
may share a dotted notehead:

[musical example]

When there is a single instance of a unison, it is advisable to use two noteheads, so that part-writing is absolutely clear:

[musical example]

(See also Additional parts to point the melodic line, p. 311; Double-stemmed writing:
Unisons, p. 52; and Dotted unisons, p. 58.)

#### The same written note for both hands

The player will choose the appropriate hand to play a note on technical
grounds — it may be the hand with the longer duration, or with the more
prominent part (if both notes are of equal length). Bracket the other note:

[musical example]

### Ties between staves

When one hand takes over a tied note from the other stave, the tie crosses
from one stave to the other. The tie must connect the noteheads; a tie ending
further from the note will look like a slur. When a pitch with an accidental is
tied over to the other stave, it is useful to add the accidental in brackets to the
second chord, as a reminder (bar 2):

[musical example]

### Fingering

Fingering may be provided in educational music and otherwise to illustrate
difficult technical manoeuvres. Many editions contain no fingering at all.

Arabic numerals in a small bold roman font distinguish fingering from tuplet
numerals (which should always appear in italic).

The general principle is to place fingering as close as possible to the relevant
notes: directly above or below, in front of or even after them. Numerals
should be clear of the stave unless absolutely necessary. It is usual for right-hand fingering to go above the treble stave, left-hand fingering below the
bass stave, keeping the middle of the system clear for dynamics. However,
fingering for inner parts is usually best placed at the stem ends so as to be
close to these notes.

Stack numerals for a chord vertically, outside the stave if possible.

Consecutive horizontal numerals indicate alternating fingers for trills (see
bar 3). A vertical bracket indicates that the same finger or, more usually, the
thumb takes more than one note:

[musical example]

#### FINGER SUBSTITUTION

Finger substitution is an integral part of legato playing in organ and electronic
keyboard music. It is indicated by placing a small slur above or below the
two numerals (as in bar 4, below). Multiple fingering changes are sometimes
marked with dashes rather than small slurs. In the following example, bars
1-2 indicate all fingering above the stave, to keep the middle of the system
clear; bars 4-5 might represent a different context in which fingering for
inner parts is clearer beside individual parts. A horizontal line indicates the
duration for which an individual finger is held down:

[musical example]

### Part-writing

#### Free part-writing

Keyboard writing can move from a single line to any number of parts as
required from beat to beat. Where it is not significant for each note of a chord
to be considered as an individual part, combine parts onto single stems; this
clears the music of duplicate stems, rests and articulation. Thus parts in
rhythmic unison share stems. Any difference between the parts in terms of
articulation or dynamic requires separate stems:

[musical example]

Except when individual parts are to be indicated throughout by separate
stems, it is acceptable to revert to single stemming at the earliest opportunity:

[musical example]

For clarity, a contrapuntal phrase should preserve individual stems. If the
voicing reverts to a single line (see last bar), change between single- and
double-stemming with a new phrase rather than at the barline, unless the
two coincide:

[musical example]

#### ADDITIONAL PARTS

Separate stems are required only when an additional part has an individual
rhythm. It is acceptable to combine additional parts onto a single stem so that
a second stem direction can then be used for an entry of independent
rhythm. Reverse ties away from the entry of another part:

[musical example]

#### CHORDS WITH SOME NOTES TIED

It is acceptable to use a single stem for chords in which some but not all notes
are tied. This is useful if the stave contains a second part (a). It is usually
clearer to separate the stems if there is no other part on the stave (b). However, the single stems may be retained to preserve stylistic homogeneity in
chordal writing (c):

[musical example]

#### ADDITIONAL PARTS TO POINT THE MELODIC LINE

It is an accepted convention to visually point a melodic line with separate
stems but without additional rests:

Debussy: Etudes Book 1, No.1
[musical example]

Separate stems can also function to point counter-melodies. Nineteenth-century composers, in particular, commonly added beams as well, to show
the progression of simultaneous parts. In the following example, beams are
given convenient rather than strictly correct note-values. (To separate some
parts onto a second stave, in order to give them correct note-values, would
not be a helpful alternative as all notes are doubled: it is more difficult to take
in two staves for one hand at once.) As long as the meaning is clear, such
notation is acceptable, provided all figuration has correct durations attached
(which the semiquavers in this example show):

Schumann: Konzert ohne Orchester
[musical example]

#### USE OF RESTS

To keep the stave as uncluttered as possible, use rests sparingly for additional parts: when both hands are already playing, the pianist does not want to
read extra rests, except to clarify the placing of additional parts that have
independent rhythm.

When there are two rhythmically independent parts on a stave, rests should
make up the value of the bar for each part (see example Whole-bar rests for
extended part-writing, below).

When further parts enter and there is little room in which to place rests, it is
necessary to make up the duration of a beat only for the extra parts:

[musical example]

Parts on one stave share a rest where possible (as at the beginning and end
of the above example). If a double-stemmed group is present, additional parts
require their own rests:

[musical example]

(See also Single-line passage-work, p. 317.)

There is no need to use whole-bar rests for individual parts except where
there is extended part-writing:

#### Whole-bar rests for extended part-writing

[musical example]

If both hands play in the same range and therefore can be written on the
same stave, figuration treated as a single-line part may dispense with rests:

[musical example]

(If notes for each hand are separated onto individual staves, rhythms become
unclear and double-stemmed notation should be used instead — see Double-
stemmed beams, p. 315.)

This same convention is occasionally useful for a single-stave part (see
Alternating the same pitch on two or more strings, p. 395).

#### Strict counterpoint

In strict contrapuntal writing, each part takes separate stems and rests
throughout. This includes whole-bar rests for each part. Thus counterpoint
in four parts should have rests for three parts if there is only one line
present. This clarifies the number of parts and the position of the voice
present in relation to the others: usually two voices are allocated to each
stave, rests placed above or below the middle line to reflect the higher or
lower voice (see example Whole-bar rests for extended part-writing, opposite).

#### THREE PARTS ON A STAVE

Space considerations may determine the stem direction of a middle part, but
ideally it should retain one direction within a phrase.

When there are two stems in the same direction, displace the lower part to
the right. The noteheads should overlap vertically wherever possible (a). It is
acceptable to place a beam through the stem of another part if necessary (b):

[musical example]

Overriding the above rule, a part with a tail or beam moves to the right so
that parts do not collide:

[musical example]

When noteheads cannot overlap, allow plenty of room between beats so that
it is clear which notes belong to which beat; to close up the spaces between
beats creates confusion:

[musical example]

### Common beam for both hands

This notation combines what would otherwise be two rhythms on separate
staves into one rhythm, thus minimizing the notation. Where material may
be considered as a single part, any group of beamed notes that is divided
between the staves may be amalgamated in this way.

Join the stems of a beat to a common beam, either between the staves (a), or
above or below the system (b). This is clearer to read than allocating each
hand separate stems on the same stave (c), and much simpler than separate
rhythms (d):

[musical example]

but not

[musical example]

nor [musical example]

#### USE OF RESTS
A major advantage of a common beam is that a rest is needed only as part of
the beamed group — i.e. not as (d) above.

(See also Single-line passage-work, p. 317.)

#### Beams above and below whole group

The note furthest from the middle of the system determines the stem direction (marked ↑ in the following example).

A potential problem with this notation is that stems extended across two
staves may be excessively long. It is best to reserve this notation for conditions in which it is unsuitable to have a beam centred between the staves (e.g.
when there are copious dynamic changes).

#### PITCHES CLOSE TO THE CENTRE OF THE SYSTEM

Place stems in one direction when pitches are close to the middle of the
system and the staves cannot be moved further apart due to space constraint:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

To use a double-stemmed beam, the staves must be far enough apart to give
adequate length (at least 2½ stave-spaces) to all stems.

#### Double-stemmed beams

Stems for groups of beamed notes that span both staves point towards the
centre of the system and are joined by a common beam.

#### BEAM POSITION

Position a beam so that the shortest stems in both directions are of equal
length. For clarity, keep beams clear of the staves where possible. Horizontal
beams, in particular, are hard to read against stave lines and should be
placed in the space between the staves, even if this results in unequal stem
lengths (see first example, (b), p. 325).

For beam direction, the most important consideration is to help the eye
follow the contour of the pitches. Slope the beam if the intervals of a group
go in one direction (a); otherwise, reflect the interval of the outside notes (b).
A beam should remain horizontal where a slope in the direction of the outside pitches contradicts the direction of the majority of notes (c), and where
there is no overall change in contour (d):

[musical example]

These guidelines follow the principles of beam direction (see Direction of
beam angle, p. 22). If in doubt use a horizontal beam, as this is the most conducive angle for enabling the eye to travel forward with the passage-work.

(For double-stemmed grace-note groups, see Placing diagonal lines on grace-
note groups, p. 126.)

#### PLACING ADDITIONAL BEAMS

The position of additional beams depends on the combination of stem directions. Wherever possible, place each beam so as to avoid corners of additional
beams jutting out from the main beam.

Additional beams may be placed on different sides of the same principal beam.

Place additional beams on the stem side when all the stems of the same subdivision are in the same direction (a), and when the outer stems of the same
subdivision are in the same direction (b), and when the beam is fractional (c):

[musical example]

This avoids beam corners (marked ↑):

avoid
[musical example]

When the outer notes of a subdivision have opposite stem direction, place an
additional beam so as not to create any unnecessary beam corners. If the subdivision is at the beginning of the main beam, place an additional beam on
the opposite side to the first note:

[musical example]

If the subdivided group occurs at the end of main beam, place an additional
beam on the side of the first note:

[musical example]

When groups combine both of the above, it is best to keep all additional
beams on the same side of the main beam (it is distracting if the secondary
beam moves position — it can look like another additional beam):

[musical example]

(For notation of double-stemmed beaming with two-note tremolos, see
Between two staves, p. 227.)

#### PLACING ARTICULATION

Place articulation next to the relevant noteheads. When a double-stemmed
group is an inner part, each marking goes next to the beam, on the opposite
side to the stem (bar 2):

[musical example]

### Both hands playing simultaneously

When both hands occasionally play simultaneously in a passage of otherwise single-part writing, it is acceptable to join notes for both hands with a
single stem. It is better not to have notes attached to different sides of the
stem; this is visually disconcerting because the noteheads do not align:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

### Single-line passage-work

When a single line of passage-work is to be divided between the hands, allocate notes on the system as appropriate for the hand distribution. As long as
it is clear where the beats fall, it is acceptable to use rests only as part of the
single line, placing them on the stave of the surrounding notes (see following example (a), p. 318).

Where there is a double-stemmed group, place the rest according to its position within the beat. At the beginning and end of a subdivision of a beat,
place the rest on the same stave as the remainder of the subdivision, in order
to clarify which beat the rest refers to (b); when the rest comes in the middle
of a beat, place it on the stave of the note it precedes (c):

[musical example]

(See also examples under Slurs across two staves, p. 321.)

Rests that make up the beginning and end of a beat need appear on one stave
only, beside the remainder of the beat (a). However, for clarity rests may be
added to both staves (b):

[musical example]

or [musical example]

Whole-beat rests are best duplicated on both staves to clarify the position of
other beats:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

#### RESTS CENTRED MID-SYSTEM

When a rest is relevant to both staves, it is acceptable to centre it in the
middle of the system. This notation works effectively with double-stemmed
beams (a). In all other cases, it can be disconcerting for the eye to need to
jump to the centre of the system to take in centred rests (b):

(a) acceptable
(b) not recommended

[musical example]

Rests that occur in the course of a double-stemmed beam are best placed on
the stave — either above or below the beam — since those that cut through a
beam obscure the rhythm:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

Centred rests should not be used where the music requires many dynamics
or technical instructions in the middle of the system, as this space will
become cluttered.

### Placing tuplet indications

#### With double-stemmed beams

When an individual tuplet has stems in one direction, centre the tuplet
numeral opposite the stems (a). When the tuplet has mixed stem direction,
numerals are usually best placed outside the group so as to be most conspicuous (see first two examples, p. 320). However, if the numeral is sufficiently clear beside the beam, place the numeral on the opposite side to the
middle stem or stems (b).

Numerals will have to be placed next to a beam when a double-stemmed
group is an inner part ((b), bar 2):

[musical example]

Where the outer stems of an even-numbered group are in opposite directions, the numeral can go on either side of the beam. If there is a fractional
beam, place the numeral on the opposite side:

[musical example]

To be most conspicuous, place numerals outside the stave and enclose them
in brackets. Consecutive tuplet indications are easiest to read when all are
placed above the stave:

[musical example]

Place the occasional tuplet indication closest to the outside notes of the
group, or, if more suitable, closest to the majority of notes, as in bar 2:

[musical example]

#### Tuplets without beams spanning both staves

Where single-line passage-work spans the two staves, a tuplet indication
should be visibly relevant to both staves. To clarify the single line, stems of
tuplet notes should point into the middle of the system (as if they were
beamed).

Where the outer notes are on different staves, the bracket should be centred
with its ends pointing towards each outer note:

[musical example]

Where the outer notes are on the same stave, it is usually clearest to add rests
for each hand, together with separate tuplet indications (a). If the notation
is clear without rests, the bracket should go above or below the whole
group ((b) or (c)), but it should not appear to exclude notes on one of the
staves (d):

[musical example]

but not

[musical example]

(See also The tuplet numeral, p. 193, and The tuplet bracket, p. 194.)

### Placing slurs

In keyboard layout, it is usual to allocate slurs to both staves, even when both
hands have the same phrasing. Slurs for the lower stave may be placed below
the stave, so as to leave the middle of the system clear for dynamic markings.

(For general placing of slurs, see Positioning relative to the stave, p. 110.)

#### Slurs across two staves

#### ALL STEMS IN ONE DIRECTION

Place the slur next to both first and last noteheads:

[musical example]

#### STEMS IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS

The slur may also be placed next to first and last noteheads (a), although it is
better if it does not intersect the middle of the phrase (b):

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

Often the slur will need to appear above or below the whole group (e.g. to
avoid mid-system dynamics):

[musical example]

or [musical example] 

#### DOUBLE-STEMMED GROUPS

Place the slur on the side of the group that has the majority of notes:

[musical example]

When there are equal numbers of notes on each stave, the slur can go either
above or below the group. However, it should not intersect a beam, as this is
confusing graphically:

[musical example]

but not

[musical example]

All notes must appear to be included in a slur — notes a long way from the
slur (marked ↑) fail to do this. A slur may be placed at the stem end of the
group's outer notes in order to achieve the required inclusive appearance:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

A slur for a double-stemmed inner voice is extremely awkward to place
satisfactorily, and is best avoided. If essential, it should go from notehead to
stem or vice versa, so that it does not cut through a beam:

[musical example]

### Placing dynamics

Dynamics that apply to both hands are centred between the staves.

Individual dynamics for each hand should, in the first instance, stay in the
middle of the system, but move close to their associated stave (see first
example under Fingering, p. 309; also, Schoenberg extract, p. 338). This allows
the space either side of the system to be clear for slurs, tuplet brackets and
octave signs.

If positioning dynamics for both hands mid-system is insufficiently clear,
place those for (usually only) one hand outside the system. The overriding
consideration should be that dynamics are as close as possible to the part
they affect. Thus the layout of the music will determine whether right-hand
dynamics go above or left-hand dynamics go below the stave.

Dynamics for independent lines on the same stave should be placed at the
stem end of each part. It is very important, especially in complex notation,
that they are as close to their parts as possible, so as not to be overlooked:

[musical example]

#### Placing hairpins with double-stemmed beams

The stems and beams of double-stemmed groups may obstruct the placing
of hairpins in the middle of the system. However, a hairpin placed outside
the system may seem too far from the notes to which it refers. In such
contexts, a hairpin may be angled through the stave as long as it can take
sufficient slant to distinguish it from the stave-lines. At least one end of the
hairpin should extend outside the stave, so as to be conspicuous:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

As a last resort a hairpin may intersect stems. A hairpin should never
intersect a beam. In the following example the hairpin needs to be placed
mid-system to clarify that it applies to both hands:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

### Octave signs

It is best to write the occasional extreme ledger-line notes at pitch, as this
shows the contour of the line and indicates the hand stretch for the player. It
is helpful to add the pitch name beside a note of five or more ledger lines,
enclosed in a box or circle. This is especially important in ensemble music,
where the keyboard player may need to look away from the music frequently
(see lower example, p. 325).

For more than the occasional ledger-line note, octave signs may be used
freely, although it is best if possible to keep a passage in a single transposition (i.e. representing one geographical position on the keyboard).

An octave sign applies only to the stave above or below which it is placed.
Even in single-line passage-work it is best to use individual signs for each
stave, to avoid ambiguity. If both hands are displaced by one or two octaves,
both staves require 8va or 15ma signs, even where there is a common beam
for both hands (bar 4):

[musical example] 

When octave transposition occurs only in one hand of a common beam,
individual octave signs should enclose only the relevant notes (a), so that the
notes of the other hand are not mistakenly included in the octave transposition (c). When it is impractical to use separate octave signs, add loco ('at
pitch') to the stave that is notated at sounding pitch (b):

[musical example]

but not
[musical example]

and not
[musical example]

L.H. octave is ambiguous

#### OCTAVE-TRANSPOSED AND AT PITCH NOTES ON ONE STAVE
An octave sign applies to all parts on a stave. A note written with an octave
transposition should not share a stave with a note to be played simultaneously at pitch (loco) if there is a feasible alternative layout. Transfer either
the ottava or the loco pitches to another stave. If necessary, add a third stave
for this.

Where there is not room for a third stave, the occasional octave-transposed
note may be placed on the same stave as notes played at pitch, provided that
the extent of the octave transposition is absolutely clear. For clarification,
extend a dotted line vertically to encompass occasional octave-transposed
pitches (see Vertical extension line, p. 31); for occasional notes written at pitch,
extend a horizontal dotted line after loco for the relevant duration:

[musical example]

(See also Octave signs, p. 28.)

### Glissandos

A solid diagonal line indicates a glissando. The glissando should not be
written out as a scale, as this represents separate fingering for each note.

The starting note will normally indicate whether the glissando is on the
white or the black keys, but this may be clarified by the instruction white-note
gliss. or black-note gliss.;

[musical example]

(See also Glissando on the strings, p. 340; for general notation, see Glissandos,
p. 140.)

### Note Clusters

When more than a few adjacent notes are to be played simultaneously, notate
these as a note cluster, in order to save writing (and reading!) handfuls of
adjacent notes and accidentals.

Henry Cowell was the first composer to use specific notation for clusters
(he instructs the pianist that the left-hand clusters are to be played with the
forearm):

Cowell: The Tides of Manaunaun
[musical example]

Cowell's notation defines the outer pitches of the cluster with ordinary noteheads. Both sides of the minim and semibreve noteheads are joined with a
stem; shorter note-values are joined with a centred vertical bar:

Cowell's notation

white-key clusters | black-key clusters | chromatic clusters
--- | --- | ---
[musical example] | [musical example] | [musical example]

(See Defining the type of cluster, p. 328.)

As an alternative design, a vertical bar may join notes of any duration.
However, the bars are not as visually apparent, especially in the last two
examples:

alternative notation

[musical example]

For clusters with a narrow range, place the bar before the chord to make it
more visible. If there are accidentals, keep the bar beside the noteheads
(between accidentals and chord):

narrow-range clusters

without accidentals | with accidentals
--- | ---
[musical example] | [musical example]

(It is usually better to write clusters of only three or four notes in full if there
is room. However, there is an obvious advantage in using cluster notation
where there are many tied chords.)

A cluster may also be notated as a narrow rectangle in which square or
rounded ends replace its outer noteheads. Semibreves and minims are white
rectangles, shorter values are black rectangles.

The rectangle is useful for indicating approximate-pitch clusters, since it may
be placed above, below or in the middle of the system without ledger lines.
Thus its outer notes can appear appropriately imprecise — see following
example (a). Define clusters intended to be approximately pitched in an
explanatory note: 'clusters to be in the approximate pitch range indicated'.
(For options to show approximate pitch without a stave, see On a line or grid:
Chords and clusters, p. 642.) 

If rectangles are to represent precise cluster ranges, then chords above and
below a stave require ledger lines as normal (b):

(a) wide clusters | (b)
--- | ---
[musical example] | [musical example]
hand | forearm
 | 
narrow clusters | 

If a piece requires both precise-pitch and approximate-pitch clusters, use
clusters with noteheads for precise pitches, and rectangles for approximate
pitches.

A cluster to be played in a particular way requires a verbal instruction: with
palm, fist, forearm, etc. (as in (b) above).

#### TIES AND DURATION DOTS
A cluster that has conventional outer noteheads requires a tie and duration
dot for both noteheads. Place these at both ends of a rectangular cluster.
(Small-interval clusters may take a single duration dot: see example, p. 642.)

#### Defining the type of cluster

#### BLACK- AND WHITE-KEY CLUSTERS

Cowell defined black- and white-key clusters with accidentals placed directly
above a chord on the upper stave, and above or below a chord on the lower
stave. This is clear and space-efficient notation. Assign the outer pitches of
black-key clusters correct accidentals (a). Rectangular clusters of precise
pitch may also be defined in this way (b). Alternatively, an over-sized accidental may be placed in front of the chord replacing all other accidentals.
These large symbols should be avoided if they overly distort note-spacing,
although they do not do so in this example (c):

(a) Cowell's notation | (b) using rectangular noteheads | (c) using large accidentals
--- | --- | ---
[musical example] | [musical example] | [musical example]
or | | 

Black and white rectangles should always define duration and not black and
white keys. Shading must not contradict duration, otherwise minim and
crotchet values cannot be distinguished.

#### CHROMATIC CLUSTERS

For precisely pitched chromatic clusters, it is best to assign individual accidentals to the outer notes. Although not essential, this does clarify these
pitches. (The third example is less clear in this respect although its notation
can be clarified in a performance note.) Define the cluster type with the written instruction Chromatic Cluster:

chromatic cluster | chromatic cluster
--- | ---
[musical example] | [musical example]
or | or
[musical example] | [musical example]

outer pitches include both # and ♮ keys

#### VERBAL DEFINITION
When all clusters in a work are of the same type, it is acceptable to indicate
this once only in the preface or as a footnote at the first appearance, e.g. 'all
clusters are chromatic'.

It may be appropriate to describe the occasional white- or black-key cluster
verbally rather than to place accidentals above or below the stave.

Alternatively, to distinguish black- and white-key clusters, state at the outset
that a cluster with flat or sharp outer pitches is black-key, a cluster without
accidentals or with natural signs is white-key (or a cluster without accidentals is chromatic, if this is is the case).

(For notation of silent clusters, see Silently depressed keys, p. 338; for cluster
glissandos, see With clusters, p. 143.)

### Stave layouts

#### Layouts for four hands

#### DUET FORMAT

The upper part is labelled Primo or I, the lower part Secondo or II. The
traditional arrangement of placing the parts on facing pages (Table 1 (a),
p. 331) is essential in educational music since a pupil's part requires a
separate page (a score would contain too much information for the pupil to

[musical example] 

read, and a page not placed directly in front of the player too difficult to see
at an oblique angle). Facing pages should contain the same number of bars
(for page-turns). For orientation, where practical, it is helpful if each part
contains the same number of bars on each system.

For concert repertoire, the traditional arrangement makes it almost impossible to study the music. It has been replaced largely by score arrangement,
Primo above Secondo (b). This format has the advantage that each player can
see exactly what is happening in the other part at all times (see Table 1,
opposite).

#### TWO-PIANO FORMAT

This uses the score arrangement (b). The top staves are labelled Piano I or I,
the lower staves Piano II or II.

For both piano duet and two-piano arrangements in score format, place
tempo markings above each pair of staves, so that they are clearly visible for
each pianist.

#### Player with two keyboards

When one player plays two keyboards simultaneously (e.g. two electronic
keyboards placed one above the other), place the music for each keyboard on
a separate stave or pair of staves. Assign each stave or pair of staves
individual curly braces and barlines. (The systemic barline on the left-hand
side of the music always joins the whole system.) The smaller keyboard is
placed above the larger one, and therefore the stave (or staves) for the upper
keyboard should appear above those of the lower one. Label the staves of
each keyboard in the margin. The layout is the same as for score arrangement
of piano duet and two pianos (see Table 1 (b), opposite).

When writing for two keyboards, use a single stave for each where possible,
as it is hard to read three or four staves at once. However, if both hands alternate on each keyboard, one or both keyboards may require two staves to
clarify hand distribution.

If celesta and piano play simultaneously in a doubling part, assign the notes
for each instrument to separate staves and add instrument labels above each
stave. (Usually a celesta is played on the right and therefore its notes should
be placed on the upper stave — i.e. allocated to the right hand.)

(For one player alternating two keyboards, see Stave layout for a doubling
part, p. 512.)

#### Layouts for solo piano

The piano's capacity to sustain not only with the damper pedal but also with
the sostenuto (or middle) pedal enables it to convey multiple-layered
textures. The piano can also manage large numbers of voices, which makes
it potentially the most complex of instruments to notate.

When a piece involves many layers of sustained materials, the piano system
may at times need three or more staves. It is better to separate out dense textures onto a third or fourth stave if multiple parts are otherwise hard to read.
However, the more staves there are, the harder it is to read the whole system,
so be economical with further staves.

#### LAYOUTS OF THREE OR MORE STAVES

In the first instance aim to arrange material on the system in pitch order, as
this is easiest to read.

The curly brace and barlines join all staves of a system.

In a three-stave layout, the hands may share a third stave, as long as separate
stems show hand allocation.

In a four-stave layout, where appropriate, assign the right hand the upper
two staves and the left hand the lower two staves. If both hands share
material linked by beams, phrasing and so on, it may be clearer to separate
different material onto pairs of adjacent staves. It is helpful to label the
initial three- or four-stave system with its hand distribution — see Table 1 (c),
p. 331. 

## PIANO NOTATION

### Pedalling

#### Pedal indications

Place these beneath the lowest stave of the system, below all other notation
including an 8va bassa sign. Where different pedals are simultaneous, or markings overlap, place them in the order given in Table 2, opposite: this reflects
their physical layout. It also enables the pedals that require the most precise
and frequent manoeuvres to be closest to the notes.

It is usually very helpful to confirm the continued holding down of pedals at
the start of a new system (see final column):

TABLE 2: Pedal indications

 | activate | release | retake after clearing | to confirm pedalling at the beginning of a new system
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
damper (or sustaining) pedal | Ped. | ★ | Λ | (Ped.)
 | or | * | | 
sostenuto (or middle) pedal | Sost. Ped. | ⎿ | ⎿⏌ | (Sost. Ped.)
una corda (or soft) pedal | una corda | tre corde | | (u.c.)
 | or | una corda ⏌ | | 

Separate, short pedal markings for the same pedal should be brought in as
close as possible to the lowest stave so that they are not overlooked.
Consequently, consecutive pedal-and-release signs for a particular pedal on
the same system will not necessarily align on the same horizontal level.
However, an individual pedal-and-release instruction should always align,
for clarity. If there is room, consecutive signs may be aligned, but the main
consideration should be that no sign is too far below the stave — or it may go
unnoticed (see following example).

#### Indicating precise pedalling

Correct pedalling relies on accurate notation. Pedal indications must be vertically aligned precisely beneath the relevant notes. The pedal is depressed at
the beginning of its symbol: on the 'P' of 'Ped.', on the 'S' of 'Sost. ped.' The
upward vertical of an extension line most accurately indicates release points
(see Extent of pedalling, p. 334).

To clarify the precise point of activation in fast or complex music, extend a
vertical dotted line between a note and a pedal sign, especially where the
pedal marking is some distance from the stave:

[musical example]

#### EXTENT OF PEDALLING
An extension line terminating with an upward vertical line may indicate the
duration of any of the pedals. The line should be solid to distinguish it from
the dotted octave extension line.

The duration of the sostenuto pedal should always be indicated with an
extension line.

It is advantageous to use the traditional damper release sign * if that pedal
is held without clearing for an extended passage, since a long, continuous
extension line parallel to the stave is visually distracting (see first example
under Notes sustained with a pedal, p. 337).

#### GRADUAL DEPRESSION AND RELEASE

Gradual depression and release of a pedal is marked by a diagonal line (a).
Where a very slow lifting may require an impractically long diagonal line, use
a dotted horizontal line instead. (This line must be a different design from an
octave extension line, in order to distinguish the two.) In addition, a verbal
instruction is helpful, especially to clarify the function of a long line (b):

[musical example]

### Damper pedal

#### INTRODUCTION

Pedalling has traditionally been regarded as a standard expressive device
and therefore passages that specifically are not to use pedal should be
marked senza pedale. (Do not abbreviate to s.p. as this may be taken to refer to
the sostenuto pedal.) This instruction may be cancelled by con (or col) pedale
if deemed necessary.

Give detailed pedalling only where absolutely necessary. Where it is not
essential to be too prescriptive, general verbal instructions are always preferable, e.g. col Ped. sempre or with pedal until otherwise indicated or even pedal
every chord. The continued depression of a single pedal for many bars is often
marked Ped. sempre. However, this term is ambiguous: it may also refer to the
discretionary use of the damper pedal. Instead, use conventional pedal indications. For added clarity, indicate with an arrow that a pedal continues to be
held down: (Ped.) →

Another school of thought is that if pedalling is required it should be marked. 

#### NOTATION

The damper pedal has a traditional engraving symbol *, which should not
be used for either of the other piano pedals. (The symbol may, however, be
used for other instruments that also release a damping mechanism — e.g.
celesta, vibraphone.) Never use the abbreviation sust. (or sus.) pedal, as this
can be confused with the sostenuto pedal.

The traditional symbol has the great advantage of being immediately recognizable and also readily distinguishable from the other pedal signs (see
second example under Notes sustained with a pedal, p. 337). However, to show
very precise alignment, an ordinary roman typeface is recommended for the
damper pedal symbol. ('P' alone is also acceptable.) This allows a vertically
stemmed 'P' to align more precisely under notes than the traditional sign
(see example under Indicating precise pedalling, p. 333); compare styles in the
following two examples.

It is a convention to align the pedal symbol with the struck note, even though
the pedal is depressed immediately after the note is struck — before, if there
is a rest. It is equally valid to indicate a pedal change exactly where it occurs:
just after the next note is sounded.

When the pedal is to be retaken immediately, the traditional release sign *
often requires too much space to show accurate pedal manoeuvres: the
positioning of * Ped. can, misleadingly, look as if there is a break in sound
between one pedal marking and the next. Instead, the retake sign Λ may
be attached to an extension line (or be freestanding). It indicates a quick
release and immediate depression of the pedal. When the pedal is released at
the end of a bar and is not re-activated immediately, the release sign aligns
with the barline (see end of bar 2, below). When a barline precedes a new
attack, the release or retake sign aligns with, or just after, the following notes
(beginning of bar 2):

[musical example]

Where the sound is to be cleared by the pedal before the following attack, use
separate markings. The traditional symbols may be used where there is
sufficient space for them:

[musical example]

or [musical example]

Where a repeated pattern of pedalling occurs, it is acceptable to indicate sim.
(in the position where such markings would be placed) rather than to over-mark the music. Re-instate fresh pedal signs once the pedalling is no longer
the same.

#### Half-pedalling

Labelled 1/2 Ped., the position of the 'P' signals the depression point. Half-pedalling is shown graphically as follows:

[musical example]

### The sostenuto pedal

The sostenuto (or middle) pedal is activated after a note has been struck but
while it is held. The pedal holds the resonances of such notes but allows
other notes played subsequently to remain unsustained. (If the damper
pedal is already depressed when the sostenuto pedal is activated, the
sostenuto pedal will sustain everything.)

This pedal should be labelled Sost. Ped. ('S.P.' is an ambiguous label) or Ped.
Sost. (this gives the depression point a clear vertical 'P'). The term third pedal
is confusing since it is actually the middle pedal.

### The una corda pedal

The una corda pedal is activated before and released after a note is played.
Thus the label to depress the pedal, una corda (abbrev. u.c.), and the instruction to release it, tre corde (abbrev. t.c.), do not usually require the precise
notation given to the other pedals. However, if necessary, a horizontal 

extension line may be used. Where an una corda marking has a shorter
extension line than the other pedals, it may be placed closer to the stave
(see example under Indicating precise pedalling, p. 333).

Indicate prolonged use of the soft pedal with una corda sempre. The terms con
sord. and senza sord. should not be used to prescribe the una corda pedal.

### Notes sustained with a pedal

It may be impractical for notes sustained by the damper or sostenuto pedal
to be written for their full sounding durations. Instead they should take convenient note lengths and the pedal sign should demarcate their durations
(see Laissez vibrer, p. 72).

For the benefit of the score-reader, open ties may indicate the continuing
resonances of sustained notes as well, either after each note (or chord), or
across each barline:

[musical example]

It is useful to indicate notes that are held in the sostenuto pedal (as opposed
to the damper pedal) in brackets at the beginning of a new system — or, if useful, at the beginning of each bar — as long as this does not clutter the part. The
repeated pitches clarify that they should be sustained. Placing the sustained
notes in brackets shows that the hand is released from the keys:

[musical example]

Notes to be held manually (i.e. not just in a pedal) should be notated for
their full length.

### Silently depressed keys

A silently depressed key releases the dampers of that key and when another
key is struck, sympathetic vibrations resonate. (A note struck a perfect
fourth, fifth or octave from a silently depressed key produces the strongest
harmonics.)

Write the silently depressed key as a diamond-shaped note. Crotchet and
shorter note-values take black diamond notes:

Schoenberg: Pierrot Lunaire
[musical example]

A pitch can be sustained once the key is released by first silently depressing
the lower octave (or a lower note related to the same harmonic series). Notate
the depressed notes for the required duration of the sound:

[musical example]

A cluster uses the same notation style as ordinary note clusters:

[musical example]

A note may be retaken silently after a percussive attack, to sustain it with a
sudden drop in dynamic. A dotted tie attached to the silently depressed note
is a useful way of conveying this sense of continuity:

[musical example]

### Effects produced inside the piano

#### Harmonics

One hand strikes the key (the fundamental), the other touches the strings of
the same pitch at a specified point (the node: this may be 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4 of the
length of the string) to produce a particular harmonic.

Notate the pitch to be played on the keys as normal. Indicate the sounding
pitch of the harmonic (the partial) in brackets above, topped with a harmonic
circle. This technique requires an explanatory instruction: Touch the node at the
nth partial.

To produce a harmonic while plucking the string, one hand plucks the written pitch while the other touches the node of the same string. Add the
instruction pizz. (bar 3):

[musical example]

(See Plucking the strings, below; for numbering of harmonics, see Natural
harmonics, p. 414.)

#### PLUCKING THE STRINGS

This is indicated pizz., more specifically:

verbal instructions | technique
--- | ---
pizz. (fingertip) | fingertip
pizz. (nail) or pizzicato nail | with fingernail
pizz. (plectrum) | plectrum

Pizz. ord. indicates plucking with the fingertip after another pizzicato technique has been used.

#### GLISSANDO ON THE STRINGS

It is important to differentiate a glissando across many strings from a lengthwise scrape or slide along the strings of a single pitch:

glissando/strum across strings | fingertip
--- | ---
glissando/scrape along the strings of given pitch | with fingernail, plectrum/ [other object]

A conventional diagonal glissando line can indicate only a glissando across
the strings of different pitches (a). A trill line may be used to indicate the
duration of a scrape along the wound copper strings of a single pitch (b):

[musical example]

#### STRIKING THE STRINGS
A verbal instruction is the simplest way to indicate striking the strings with
mallets, beaters, sticks or any other object:

[musical example]

#### DAMPING THE STRINGS

Strings may be damped or muted individually with one hand while the
other plays on the keys.

At the start of the passage, notate the pitches to be damped as small notes in
brackets on the stave of the hand that damps the strings. Place a cross over
each key affected by the muting (or extend a horizontal bracket for its duration):

[musical example]

A plus sign may also show damping with a finger once the string is plucked
(a) and after keys have been played (b). The instruction damp is needed only
at the first appearance:

[musical example]

Strings may be muted collectively by laying material (cloth, wood, metal
strip, etc.) across them. Specify the range that the prescribed material should
cover, i.e. the pitches that will be muted. A cross through the stems of the
muted notes may indicate the difference between ordinary notes and these
muted (prepared) notes. (The crosses are not essential for the pianist, since
no further action is required once the cloth is in place, and should not be
used if they clutter the part.)

Using the following instruction, the subsequent notation would be:

instruction | strip of cloth placed over the following strings, 1" from hammers
--- | ---
notation | [musical example]

#### PERCUSSIVE EFFECTS ON THE FRAME

To knock parts of the instrument such as the soundboard, frame or lid, place
crossed noteheads at the edge of the stave together with a verbal instruction.
Alternatively, create a separate line mid-system or above the staves (for notation style, see examples under Harp: Percussive sounds on body of instrument,
p. 369).

The works of George Crumb are a good reference point for playing inside the
piano: they give clear instructions for the techniques required (see, for
instance, Celestial Mechanics).

Consider carefully the most appropriate page format for a pianist who may be
required to perform manoeuvres inside the piano (see Landscape format, p. 482;
see also Performance instructions, p. 491).

### The prepared piano

Materials to be inserted between the strings, and their dimensions, must be
stated at the outset. It is essential to specify the make of piano on which the
preparation has been calculated, since modification may be required
between different makes.

The piano notation should indicate the keys that the pianist is to play, regardless of actual sounding pitches. (It is advisable to state in the preparation
instructions any necessary resultant pitches.) If required, the difference
between prepared and ordinary notes may be indicated with a cross through
the stems of the prepared notes, as when strings are muted collectively (see
lower example, p. 341).

Details for preparation should be given in the preface as well as in the appropriate place in the music. (Cage's prepared piano scores are classic examples,
for instance, Sonatas and Interludes; see also Adès, Chamber Symphony, which
gives comprehensive instructions for preparation.)

## ORGAN NOTATION

### Page format

Organ music is best presented in landscape format since music stands are
often necessarily high in relation to eye level and the organist may have
difficulty reading the top of a portrait-format page. Landscape format will
have fewer systems per page and thus the player need move his or her eye less
frequently around the page. This is a great advantage to a player who needs
to shift attention from the music to the physical aspects of playing.

(See also Landscape format, p. 482.)

Page-turns must be organized with care, especially where they coincide with
changes in registration (see Page-turns, p. 559).

### System layout

Organ music with a pedal part should normally be written on three staves. The
pedal notes are always placed exclusively on the lowest stave. The manual
staves are braced together; the pedal stave is excluded from the brace. It is
essential that the pedal stave has separate barlines: the player requires the
visual separation of manual and pedal staves.

It is recommended that three staves be used throughout, even if pedal
notes are infrequent: the blank stave signals just that. However, an extended
section for manuals alone may omit the pedal stave. If it is necessary to
compress a layout to avoid a page-turn, then all redundant staves may be
deleted and the system reduced to a minimum.

The staves at the beginning of a piece are usually labelled Manual (or Man.)
and Pedal (or Ped.), although this is not strictly necessary for a standard three-stave layout. Labelling is essential only for the sake of clarity or at a change
of layout: when the system is reduced to one or two staves, and if the two-stave manual part requires further staves.

It is best to use no more than two staves for the manuals even when the
hands alternate between two or more of them: the greater the number of
staves the harder the music becomes to read. Keep right-hand notes in the
upper stave, left-hand notes in the lower stave, regardless of manual changes.
Under the extreme conditions of complex interchanges between hands and
manuals it is permissible to have separate staves for each manual, but only if
a two-stave manual part would otherwise be very cluttered. In this case, the
pair of staves for each manual takes a separate curly brace and separate
barlines, and the manual numerals or labels (if prescribed) may be indicated
in the margin:

[musical example]

A single-stave manual part must take a compressed curly brace if there is
also a pedal stave present, to distinguish the two: a pedal stave never takes
a brace:

[musical example]

#### PLACING TEMPI AND DYNAMICS
Tempo indications are placed above the top stave. Dynamics for the manuals
go between the two staves, or may be allocated below each manual stave
separately. Dynamics for the pedals go below the pedal stave. Pedals often
do not have separate dynamics unless there is a pedal solo, or where a section begins with a pedal entry at a new dynamic (see example, p. 346). 

### Two-stave layout

An organ accompaniment to a choral work may be arranged on just two
staves, either to save space in a vocal score or when the part also functions
as a keyboard accompaniment for rehearsal purposes. (From the organist's
point of view, however, it is always preferable that the pedals have their own
stave, even if playing only occasionally.)

The most important feature of a two-stave part is that it is absolutely clear
which notes are for manuals and which for pedals. This is because the standard octave for pedal notes is assumed to be 16' (i.e. sounding an octave
lower than written) unless otherwise indicated (see also Registration, p. 346).

The left hand and pedals share the lower stave. Left-hand notes may move
into the upper stave, taking down-stems, if they would be notated more
clearly in the treble clef (see following example, last bar). On the lower stave
pedal notes take down-stems, left-hand notes up-stems. The left-hand and
pedal parts have separate rests, although they may share a whole bar's rest
(bar 3). Maintain rests for the absent part (the last bar has no rest since the
left-hand notes have moved into the upper stave; in this case the pedal part
can resume ordinary stem direction):

[musical example]

When either the left-hand or the pedal part is absent for an extended passage,
it is acceptable to omit rests for whichever part is silent and to resume conventional stem direction for the single part that remains. In this case, the pedals
alone are labelled Ped., the left hand alone is labelled Man. or without Ped.

### Manuals

The number and description of manuals can change from instrument to
instrument. The physical position of manuals on the console is also variable.
Manuals are chosen according to the available stops, and according to any
prescribed registration (see Registration, p. 346).

The range of stops available on individual manuals is so variable that it is
best not to prescribe specific manuals, but rather to give general dynamic
descriptions. The one exception is the Swell box, which must be specified if
it is required (see example opposite; see also Crescendos and diminuendos,
p. 347).

To prescribe contrasting manuals use roman numerals, in preference to
names (Great, Choir, etc), so that manuals may be chosen from those present.
(Numerals are universal, whereas manual names are region-specific.) The
numerical order is hierarchical, I being the most powerful manual in dynamic
terms (therefore, usually, I = Great).

#### PLACING MANUAL INDICATIONS
Manual indications go above the relevant stave or are centred between the
manual staves if they apply to both: the less information that needs to be
indicated the clearer the part. When hands change manual in different places,
place a manual label above each stave (see following example, bar 5, p. 346).

If necessary, a vertical bracket or arrow may point the exact place of change
in passage-work. An arrow is less distracting (bar 9). Occasionally a bracket
may be the only clear way to show that not all notes are included in the
manual change (see following example, bar 12, p. 346).

#### Coupling

When stops of one manual are added to another manual or to the pedals, this
is known as coupling. When coupling occurs, the most common indications
are as follows. It is customary to see indications such as these set out at the
beginning of the piece:

I(+II) or
I(II coupled)

Indicate changes during a piece with as brief a description as possible:

+II
or
add II

Coupling is cancelled as follows. Assuming a manual indication of I:

-II
or
II off

or as Coup. off or uncoupled. 

Coupling changes should be placed in the same position as manual
indications:

[musical example]

### Registration

Registration is defined by stops comprising timbre and pitch. For manuals,
pitches other than the standard 8' stop should be specified (Table 3 (a)). The
standard pitch for the pedal is 16' unless otherwise indicated; therefore
specify 8' only if pedal notes are to sound at written pitch.

Regarding timbres, since specific instruments have an individual range of
stops, it is advisable to specify only dynamics and general tonal characteristics chosen from families of stops (e.g. Principals, Flutes, Reeds, Strings) and
the Mutation stops (Mixtures). This leaves the player free to choose appropriate stops (see Table 3 (b), opposite).

Before the beginning of the piece, it may be helpful to indicate the style of
instrument, so that all possible information is available in order to adapt the
piece to another organ in the most appropriate way. A more prescriptive
registration (as in Table 3 (c), opposite) may be adapted for the organ in
question.

Registration may be given in a number of ways. It is customary to prescribe
it for each manual at the outset, listing it above the tempo indication, at the
top left of the opening page. In the course of the piece, place registration
changes above the stave to which they refer, or between the manuals staves
if they refer to both.

List manual stops above pedal stops; longest pipes first, separately for each
manual and for the pedals:

TABLE 3: Registration examples

(a) without defining specific manuals | (b) prescribing stops but not specific manuals | (c) prescribing manuals and stops
--- | --- | ---
I 8', 4' | I Principal 8', 4' | Great Principal 8', 4'
II 8', 4' | II Flutes 8', 4' | Swell Flutes 8', 4'
III 8' | III Clarinet 8' | Choir Clarinet 8'
Pedal 16', 8' + I to Ped. | Pedal 16', 8' + I to Ped. | Pedal 16', 8' + Gt. to Ped.

### Crescendos and diminuendos

Adding or reducing stops (a 'register crescendo/diminuendo') is prescribed
'add' and 'reduce'. These terms differentiate such a dynamic change from the
crescendo and diminuendo of a Swell box.

The Swell box is the only means of making dynamic alterations without
adding or reducing stops. The use of dynamic hairpins is assumed to mean
opening and closing the Swell box (see example, p. 344). The alternative indications 'Swell (closed) / (open)' and 'open/close Swell box' are more cumbersome. (If the player cannot achieve the required dynamic alteration with the
Swell, then he/she will make a register diminuendo/crescendo. It is unnecessary to prescribe this.)

### Pedal markings

Indications of heel U or o and toe Λ or V are usually the technical province
of the player, but will be given as technical advice in a tutor. Except in a tutor,
the organist will always prefer to read the resultant articulation or phrasing
the composer intends, leaving him or her free to work out the best way of
achieving it.

Place indications for the right foot above the stave, below for the left foot (the
symbols are not inverted below the stave). A substitution of the heel for the
toe or toe for the heel on the same note is usually marked with a short tie (a
dash is sometimes used):

[musical example] 

A slide between adjacent pedals while retaining the foot position is usually
marked with a dash: U- U and Λ—Λ (a short tie, as illustrated on p. 347, is
sometimes used).

An illustration of these pedal markings is as follows:

[musical example]

A substitution of one foot for the other on the same note is marked by a diagonal line (a), a rounded line (b) or short slurs (c) — the latter is more discreet,
and useful where ties are present:

[musical example]

### Keys held down with wedges or weights

Use a contrasting note shape to indicate the point at which a note or range
is no longer held manually but must be weighted, wedged down or held by
an assistant. An instruction above or below the appropriate stave should
indicate this.

It is important to show the full duration of all held keys. If the notation of
many held keys and their ties clutters the stave, place these pitches on a third
manual stave above the others. If the ties give the passage a dense appearance, consider using stemless notes and extenders up to the point of release
(see Extenders at notehead level, p. 632).

(For notation specific to an electronic keyboard, see Sampled sounds, p. 601.)
