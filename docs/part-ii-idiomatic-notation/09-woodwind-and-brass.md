# 9. Woodwind and Brass

## GENERAL TOPICS

When writing for woodwind and brass instruments, it is best to be precise in musical intent but not too technically prescriptive, since instrument design is constantly being modified. The player will always find a way to produce the prescribed sound. Unconventional techniques can be described with conventional notation and verbal explanation: this chapter includes the most commonly used techniques.

### Articulation

A wind player separately articulates each note unless it is marked with a slur. A slur indicates a complete legato from note to note. When notes within the slur have articulation marks, each has a separate attack, although the slur modifies the degree of separation:

[musical example]

Articulation is more pronounced when there are no slurs:

[musical example]

(See also Articulation marks, p. 114.)

In woodwind music, it is ungrammatical to write a slur over a reiterated pitch without additional articulation marks. Since each note must be tongued, tenuto lines or even staccato dots should be added under the slur to indicate this rearticulation. Alternatively, use a written instruction to indicate legato playing:

[musical example]

legato

In brass music, a slur over repeated notes indicates legato tonguing:

[musical example]

(For placing slurs with two-note tremolos, see Slurs, p. 228.)

### Phrasing

Phrasing indications are best omitted from wind music: reserve the slur to show legato articulation. Additional indication of phrase structure independently of legato slurs is more confusing than helpful: when there are two sets of slurs it is difficult to tell which is which, or to judge if the role of the slur is inconsistent, and players will therefore have to decide for themselves how to interpret the markings. Furthermore, the player may question whether or not a phrase mark modifies the articulation within it.

A dotted slur may be used if it is essential to show phrase structure. However, this is not recommended as the dotted slur is visually more complicated and the performer will always question its meaning.

#### BREATH MARKS

Â« indicates a breathing point. This sign should be used only specifically to indicate a break in the sound. Otherwise breathing should be left to the player.

[musical example]

A phrase mark should not be used to indicate that a phrase is to be played in one breath: the player may have to breathe elsewhere for technical reasons. Rests are often used as part of a musical phrase, and are not necessarily indicative of a breath.

The time taken for the breath is subtracted from the previous note. Reserve the comma (') for a short pause or lift during a phrase (see Pauses: Break in sound, p. 187).

### Tonguing

It is not necessary to specify how the player should articulate: he or she chooses whether to single-, double- or triple-tongue according to context. Double- or triple-tonguing may be requested as a written instruction, although it is a technical matter and does not materially affect the sound.

The tongue actions that articulate double- and triple-tonguing are usually equated to forming the consonants t-k and t-k-t respectively. It is not necessary to specify these since the player modifies tonguing as a matter of course, according to the notated articulation. Appropriate verbal instructions, if required, are soft-tongued, hard-edged attack, etc.

#### FLUTTER-TONGUING

Flutter-tonguing is notated as a tremolo, with an abbreviation above the stave: flt. or frull. (Italian: frullato) or flz. (German: Flatterzunge). It is important to give the verbal indication, so that the tremolo is not interpreted as very fast, rhythmic tonguing. The instruction needs to be cancelled only when a flutter-tongued tied note changes to an ordinary sustained note. Draw the player's attention to such a change by adding ord., nat. or norm. to the ordinary note:

[musical example]

### Microtones

Microtonal pitches can be achieved by inflecting the pitches of the tempered twelve-note scale by means of lip and embouchure adjustment. In addition, woodwind instruments have special fingerings for many microtones. The player will choose the most suitable way of producing the required microtone. Therefore, in general, it is best to spell microtones according to the musical context. If it is the case that the player must bend a pitch up or down to achieve the required microtone, notate the microtone according to how the player will approach it. For example, where a pitch must be flattened, notate the microtone with a downward arrow from the semitonal pitch (see Microtones, p. 94).

### Glissandos

#### Conventional glissandos

A conventionally notated glissando - a diagonal line between the outer pitches with a gliss. indication - is interpreted as an instruction to produce as continuous a slide as possible. This will be played according to the available technical means and musical context. (For notation of glissandos, see p. 140.)

To acknowledge where a completely smooth glissando is not technically possible, chromatic pitches may be written out in full together with a quasi gliss. indication:

[musical example]

#### Pitch bend (Lip glissando)

To bend a note is to alter its pitch by embouchure and/or throat adjustment. This may be specified as lip or bend, to emphasize that the glissando pitches are not to be chromatically fingered. The bend is notated as a line after the notehead, which may be shaped to reflect the contour of the glissando:

[musical example]

#### Chromatic glissandos

When a glissando is a scale of chromatic semitones, these should be notated in full, either as measured notes or as grace notes. Include the instruction chromatic (abbrev. chrom.) so that the player does not attempt to slide over intermediary pitches:

[musical example]

(For brass, see also Glissandos, p. 265.)

### Special techniques

A special technique may use a different-shaped notehead to distinguish it from ordinarily played notes, as long as the notation has verbal qualification (see Performance instructions, p. 491).

It is extremely important to explain a technique clearly in words. It is not essential to designate a symbol for a special technique, although it is visually helpful to do so.

An unconventional notehead should have only one meaning in a piece. When different techniques alternate, it may be helpful to use contrasting different-shaped noteheads.

Non-pitched sounds are clearest placed at the top or bottom of the stave:

[musical example]

Notate sounds that are to be pitched on the stave:

[musical example]

If groups of non-standard noteheads, or those on ledger lines, are difficult to read, use crosses through stems instead:

[musical example]

Flutter-tonguing, harmonics, multiphonics and key slaps have specific notation, as described under separate headings in this chapter. Other techniques do not. (See Kurt Stone, Music Notation in the Twentieth Century for suggested notation of various very specialized techniques.)

### Phonemes to modify timbre

The forming or changing of vowels or phonemes in the embouchure during a blown note results in a change of tone quality. Indicate the vowels or phonemes to be used below the stave in square brackets.

Qualify in a footnote the pronunciation of vowel sounds with reference to a language familiar to the player (e.g. 'i : ee as in seen, u : oo as in soon'; see also Qualifying text sounds, p. 451). A verbal instruction must make it clear that the sounds are not actually voiced:

[musical example]

(In the flute example above, the diamond note represents the fundamental, i.e. the fingered pitch; see Harmonics, p. 256.)

### Vocal sounds through an instrument

To whisper, speak, sing, hum or whistle through the instrument modifies or amplifies the sound.

#### SPEAKING THROUGH AN INSTRUMENT

Use crossed noteheads to indicate speaking through the instrument. (If groups of crossed notes are difficult to read, use a cross through stems instead.) A verbal instruction must make it clear that the player fingers the pitches and speaks through the instrument:

Crumb: Madrigals Book IV

"Speak-flute" - the Spanish words are spoken over mouthpiece of flute while fingering given pitches.
mp, ma distinto (in a hushed, breathless tone)

[musical example]

Spoken text that is entirely independent of the instrument also uses crossed noteheads, and should be labelled spoken (see also Vocal sounds from instrumentalists: Spoken part, p. 461).

#### VOCALIZING WHILE PLAYING

Pitches to be sung or hummed simultaneously with blown notes may require embouchure modification. The composer must consult a player to find out what is possible.

The sung pitches may take ordinary noteheads, as long as each entry is labelled hum or sing. However, it is often clearest to use cue-sized noteheads to differentiate the sung pitches. If there is room, place both sung and played pitches on the same stave, but with separate stems. Where it would be confusing to have both parts on one stave, place the sung notes on a separate stave below the played notes and use ordinary noteheads for both parts:

[musical example]

Alternatively, a different-shaped notehead such as a diamond note (Berio uses a triangle in his Sequenza V for trombone) may be used to distinguish visually the occasional voiced pitch:

[musical example]

Sung pitches must be correctly transposed for the relevant instrument. Write them at concert pitch for instruments that transpose at the octave. It is generally assumed that unless the pitches are in a range that can be reached by all voices, the player will transpose them up or down an octave as necessary.

Sung and played pitches to produce multiphonics: One method of producing multiphonics, and the only technique for multiphonic production on brass instruments, is to sing one note while playing another. The different frequencies interact to produce further notes or timbres:

[musical example]

(See also Multiphonics, p. 257.)

### Transposition

In performance material, woodwind and brass parts must be written at the correct transposition for the instrument (but see also Trumpet, p. 260).

Cues in a player's part must be correctly transposed for the playing instrument (see Transposition, p. 574).

In a full score, woodwind and brass may be either transposed or written at sounding pitch (see Score transposition, p. 505, and Labelling transposing instruments, p. 510; also, Playing score, p. 538).

#### Transposition and key signatures

In tonal music, each transposing instrument has its own relevant key signature. In music without a clear tonal centre, a transposed part does not take a key signature unless the concert-pitch version has one. Horns and trumpets do not usually take a key signature at all (see Key signatures, p. 263).

**TABLE 1: Transposed key signatures in a sample woodwind layout**

| Concert pitch key: | C major | E major | Ab major |
|-------------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Flute             |         |         |          |
| Alto Flute        |         |         |          |
| Cor Anglais       |         |         |          |
| Clarinets 1 in Bb |         |         |          |
|          2 in A   |         |         |          |
| or       3 in Eb  |         |         |          |

#### Enharmonic key changes

In keys remote from C major, convert the key signature enharmonically so as to use the key with the least number of sharps or flats. For example, concert pitch F# major key for a Bb major instrument should transpose to Ab rather than G# major. (A literal transposition up a tone would require a leading-note accidental of Fx.) The transposition to Ab reduces the number of accidentals:

not recommended

Extract in G# major

[musical example]

recommended

Extract in Ab major

[musical example]

When the enharmonically equivalent key has an equal number of accidentals (as in F#/Gb major), allocate the sharp key signature for instruments in sharp keys (in G, A, etc.), the flat key signature for instruments in flat keys (in F, Bb, etc.)

When a transposed part has more accidentals that contradict the key signature than confirm it, consider writing it without a key signature, instead placing accidentals in front of the relevant notes as they occur.

#### Enharmonic note-spelling

In music without key signatures, the literal transposition of a sharp-key line into a flat-key instrument (see (b) below, bars 1-2), and vice versa, leads to greater numbers of accidentals than in the original, and frequently to double sharps or double flats. To simplify reading, reduce the number of accidentals by judicious use of enharmonic equivalents (see (c) below).

Avoid double sharps and double flats, except in a tonal context that cannot easily be rewritten enharmonically. It is often better not to respell isolated notes enharmonically if this creates diminished and augmented intervals that are awkward to read (d):

(a) Concert pitch

[musical example]

(b) Literal transposition into Bb

[musical example]

(c) Enharmonic transposition

[musical example]

(d) Literal transposition removing some sharps creates awkward intervals (+1)

[musical example]

Where possible adjust the note-spelling enharmonically for a whole phrase, to avoid these awkward intervals.

(See also Note-spelling, p. 85.)

## WOODWIND

### Clefs

Flutes, oboes, clarinets and saxophones appear in the treble clef only.

Bass clarinet parts should be written for the Bb instrument, and notated in the treble clef, a ninth higher than sounding (this is known as 'French notation').

**TABLE 2: WOODWIND INSTRUMENTS Clefs and transpositions**

| | Clefs | Transposition (if any) |
|---|---|---|
| | | written | sounding |
| Piccolo | treble | | up 8va |
| Flute | treble | | |
| Alto Flute (Flute in G) | treble | | down P4 |
| Bass Flute | treble | | down 8va |
| Oboe | treble | | |
| Cor Anglais (English Horn) | treble | | down P5 |
| Oboe d'Amore | treble | | down m3 |
| Bass Oboe or Heckelphone | treble | | down 8va |
| Clarinet in Eb/in D/in Bb/in A | treble | | down m3/M2/M2/m3 |
| Basset Horn in F | treble | | down P5 |
| Bass Clarinet in Bb | French notation | treble | | down M9 |
| | German notation | bass & treble | | down M2 |
| Bassoon | bass or tenor | | |
| Contrabassoon | bass | | down 8va |

For saxophones, see Table 7: Wind band Clefs and transpositions, p. 540.

This transposition reflects the fingering and clef of the other clarinets. For clarity it may be worth stating 'in Bb', because bass clarinets in A are still found. Bb parts may also be found (usually in older music) written a tone higher than sounding ('German notation'), using the bass and treble clefs according to range. If this transposition is used (e.g. to match original performance material) then this must be stated: 'bass clarinet sounding a tone lower than written', since the octave of the part may not be obvious from an opening passage in the treble clef. A part specifically for a bass clarinet in A should use the French notation, written a minor tenth higher than sounding.

The bassoon appears in the bass clef and, for high passages, the tenor clef. Some players prefer to read a very high part (e.g. going up to E, a tenth above middle C) in the treble clef, rather than having several ledger lines in the tenor clef. Consult the individual player before using the treble clef. The contrabassoon may move into the tenor clef for high passages.

Do not write low notes in the tenor clef (this sometimes occurs when a second bassoon part is copied directly from a score in which the first two players share a stave).

#### Octave-transposing instruments

The piccolo is written an octave lower than sounding; the contrabassoon, bass flute, bass oboe and heckelphone an octave higher than sounding. It is unnecessary to use the octave-transposing clefs in a playing part, but they are helpful in a score (see Octave-transposing clefs, p. 506).

#### Octave transpositions to replace ledger lines

Reserve octave signs for the uppermost notes of the flute and piccolo (above about four ledger lines). The range of other woodwind instruments is such as to make octave transpositions unnecessary. For woodwind players, a particular pitch represents a particular fingering, and octave displacements are therefore visually confusing. This is especially true for clarinets, which have different fingerings for different octaves, as the instruments overblow at the twelfth, not the octave.

### Techniques

#### Key trills (Timbre trills)

This is the trilling of two different fingerings for the same pitch. Give an indication such as key trill or alternative fingering, and write in the trilling note, to clarify that this is not a conventional trill with the upper neighbouring note:

[musical example]

(For alternating normal and harmonic notes, see Harmonics, below.)

#### DOUBLE TRILLS

Double trills are possible on an instrument that has two keys for the same pitch. This applies to certain pitches available on the oboe. Double trills alternate left- and right-hand fingerings for one of the trilling pitches, which allows the trills to be at double speed. Notate the double trill with two trill lines. The written trilling note is specifically added in these examples to clarify at a glance that the technique required is not a timbral trill. It is useful to indicate which keys to alternate:

[musical example]

(Berio uses this notation in Sequenza VII.)

#### Harmonics

Harmonics are upper partials produced by overblowing the fundamental without altering the fingering. The sound is transparent, not so resonant, and less secure than that produced by standard fingering. A harmonic is notated as a small circle over the sounding pitch.

On the clarinet and bassoon, special fingering can achieve harmonic-sounding notes. Use the same notation as for a true harmonic.

Each harmonic note takes a circle. A non-harmonic note of the same pitch that follows a harmonic is labelled non arm, ord, norm. or nat. (norm. or nat. may be abbreviated to n to save space):

[musical example]

A flute can use different overtones of a fundamental for timbral effect. When a piece alternates different overtones, indicate the fundamental (the fingered pitch) as a diamond-shaped notehead below the sounding pitch:

[musical example]

On the flute, ordinary octave harmonics do not require this notation: use the conventional harmonic circle above the sounding pitch, as described above.

Double harmonics are possible on the oboe but require special fingering, which should be given on the advice of the oboist. They are notated with two harmonic circles above the chord:

[musical example]

(For further reading, see Peter Veale and Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf, The Techniques of Oboe Playing: a Compendium (Barenreiter, 1994).)

#### Multiphonics

Multiphonics can be produced by either over- or under-blowing a fingering for a single pitch, or by using special fingerings. (See also Sung and played pitches to produce multiphonics, p. 251.) The result is a complex pattern of vibrations in which two or more pitches are perceived simultaneously, the pitches being of unequal quality. A multiphonic will frequently comprise more complex timbres and pitches than can be easily notated - or even quantified.

For a non-specific (or non-specifiable) multiphonic, it is sufficient to indicate that a multiphonic should be produced, and to show the approximate pitch area required - or the outer extremes, if control of the upper end of the range is required. Use a contrasting notehead such as crosses or diamonds: diamond notes are more legible for minims and semibreves (see example below; also, extract from Goehr, Paraphrase, p. 259).

The multiphonics that result from certain fingerings will sometimes vary between players and between instruments. Therefore it is more helpful to describe verbally the type of sound required than to prescribe a chord that may or may not be realistically attainable, or where the pitches may be obscured by predominant timbre noise:

[musical example]

Use an ordinary notehead to indicate the pitch of a multiphonic based on a given fundamental (a), or one that is to include a specific pitch or pitches (b). Either give a verbal instruction to play a multiphonic, or for repeated use place an 'M' through the stem (the 'M' requires definition at its first appearance):

[musical example]

Multiphonics that are very definitely pitch-specific may be written as chords. These require special fingering. Indicate special fingerings as well where a particular multiphonic depends on it (for example, all double reed multiphonics require this). The fingerings are a useful reference, even if they cannot be guaranteed to transfer to an individual instrument.

#### Fingering

Where appropriate, provide fingering for multiphonics and for microtones. When alternative fingering for a single pitch is required in order to produce contrasting timbre, the fingerings are usually best left to the player, since those most suitable depend on the instrument, the player, the reed and embouchure:

[musical example]

(See also Tone Qualities, below.)

Fingering is best given as a chart for the keys and/or holes. The standard symbols for fingering should be placed directly above or below the relevant note, and are:

O = open
â¢ = closed
Ã¸ or o = half open

For the flute, a horizontal arrangement is most helpful. A vertical arrangement is best for other instruments. (For examples of fingering charts, see Alfred Blatter, Instrumentation, Orchestration, and Kurt Stone, Music Notation in the Twentieth Century.)

For repeated use of certain fingerings (e.g. for multiphonics) indicate the fingering charts in a preface. Allocate a number to each fingering and place it in the music as required. Frame the numerals in a distinctive way, to distinguish them from rehearsal marks.

#### Tone qualities

The occasional variation in tone quality can be indicated in words, e.g. 'play with different fingering to make a very soft sound'. Contrasting noteheads may differentiate other tone qualities from normal notes. 'Breathy' tone, commonly used for the flute, is often defined with an open diamond notehead. Provide a verbal definition for clarification (and to distinguish it from a harmonic):

[musical example]

In Sequenza XII for bassoon, Berio uses small circles to indicate contrasting timbres. This is a very economical notation and should be placed directly above each relevant note:

â finger for a bright timbre
â finger for a dark timbre
â between a bright and dark timbre

Verbal instructions are the clearest means of indicating the balance of tone and timbre:

Goehr: Paraphrase

[musical example]

#### Key slaps

Most commonly found in flute music, a key slap may be exaggerated to articulate a blown pitch. To indicate this, place a '+' or 'Ã' sign above the stave (no explanation is needed):

[musical example]

Key slaps may be articulated without blowing the pitch. It is important to differentiate in the notation this technique from the one above: use crossed noteheads at the fingered pitches. Define the technique at the start of the piece or at its first appearance, to clarify that no air is blown through the instrument to sound the pitch:

[musical example]

When a flautist blocks the embouchure hole with the tongue the key slap sounds about a major seventh below the fingered pitch. Notate the fingered pitch and give a verbal instruction above the stave:

[musical example]

(For other unconventional flute techniques, see Robert Dick, The Other Flute: A Performance Manual of Contemporary Techniques (Lauren Keiser, 1989).)

## BRASS

### Clefs, transpositions and key signatures

#### Trumpet

The trumpet that a player uses for any given part is a matter of personal preference, and is chosen according to the required timbre of that work. The player may, for example, choose a specific instrument for a particularly high passage. Players are used to transposing for their instruments: consequently, trumpet parts are often written in C as a matter of course, even though the player may use a trumpet in Bb, or the smaller trumpets in D or Eb, etc. Since Bb is the universal instrument, when the range of the part is not exceptionally high or low, it is equally valid to write a part in C or Bb.

(For labelling the keys of trumpet parts in a score, see Labelling transposing instruments, p. 510.)

The trumpet appears only in the treble clef. Retain the treble clef for very low notes (pedal notes), either using ledger lines below the stave or, when this becomes difficult to read, with an 8va bassa sign.
