# 10. Percussion

## Allocating Instruments to Players

When a percussion set-up requires more than one player, distribute instruments amongst a minimum number of players. Allocate each instrument to a specific player. It is not acceptable simply to give each instrument a separate stave or line, without consideration as to who will play it. A single instrument should have an individual printed part (as is the case in many older scores) only when the player cannot play any other instrument.

Always consult an experienced player before making an allocation of many instruments and a number of players. It is sometimes necessary to try out a particular distribution before making a final commitment.

### Guidelines

Allocate a group of instruments to each performer, ideally for that player alone to play. Performers prefer to play related instruments so that they can use the same type of stick to play different instruments (e.g. xylophone, glockenspiel and crotales, or bongos, tom-toms and bass drum).

If there are a number of large instruments, distribute them between players, so that one individual player does not need to cover excessive ground on the platform.

If possible, avoid sharing instruments between players. Should the concert programme contain other works with additional percussion requirements, then a player may not be able to move to a neighbouring player's instrument. However, it is a good policy to recommend how players should share. Then if a particular instrument cannot be accessed because of the set-up on the concert platform, the player can use a second instrument.

### Player Number Allocation

For the purposes of instrument allocation in orchestral music, the timpanist is considered separately from the rest of the percussion section. When a percussionist plays timpani as well as other instruments, there is not this same distinction.

The hierarchy of player numbering in percussion parts is for convenience only and does not reflect an order of difficulty. Thus the most demanding part will not necessarily be allocated to player 1.

### Score Order of Players

In a full score and playing score arrange staves (or lines) in player order so that player 1 takes the top stave or line(s), player 2 the next, and so on. Label staves by player number in the margin.

If some players play only tuned percussion and others exclusively instruments of indefinite pitch, group the tuned percussion together either at the top or the bottom of the section, e.g. as players 3 and 4, or as players 1 and 2.

#### Sample percussion score

[musical example]

(For full-score layout, margin brackets and barring, see Stave allocation for percussion.)

### Listing Instruments and Specifications

List all instruments at the front of a score and playing part. For completeness provide a list of all instruments required, and then a separate list for each player. This information is important in a part, as the player may never see the full score. It is best to compile the list once the part is completed, so as to be sure it includes all instruments.

For convenience, group instruments into (1) instruments of definite pitch (tuned percussion), and (2) instruments of indefinite pitch.

When two players share an instrument, indicate this in the listing for both players, so it is clear that they do not need an instrument each, for instance, 'player 2: bass drum (shared with player 3)'.

#### Instrument Specification

##### TUNED PERCUSSION
When a keyboard instrument does not necessarily have just one standard size, state when a particular range is required.

For other tuned percussion instruments, such as crotales, tubular bells, tuned cowbells and tuned gongs, indicate the required range or individual pitches.

Where applicable, state the written pitch of octave-transposing instruments; e.g. 'xylophone (4-octave range) sounding one octave higher than written'.

##### INSTRUMENTS OF INDEFINITE PITCH

Specify instruments by relative pitch (e.g. '3 tom-toms, low, medium and high', or '2 high cowbells of different pitches') or by relative size, if this is relevant (e.g. '2 bass drums, large and very large'). Note that cymbal sizes do not relate necessarily to pitch (cymbals send out a multiplicity of pitch impressions, depending on context), and so should be described by relative pitch and not size.

Specify any extra equipment: e.g. 'double bass bow (for cymbal)'.

## Labelling

### Abbreviations

It is important to clarify abbreviations by giving each instrument name in full, either at its first entry or listed at the outset. When instrument names are not in the player's native language it is useful to define abbreviations in brackets in the instrument listing: e.g. 'il tamburo piccolo (tamb. picc.)'.

The following different language equivalents can cause confusion because of the similar names for different instruments:

| English | French | Italian | German |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tambourine | tambour de basque | tamburo basco tamburello | Tamburin Schellentrommel |
| tabor | tambourin provençal | tamburo provenzale tamburino | Provenzalische Trommel Tambourin |
| timpano(i) | timbale(s) | timpano(i) | Pauke(n) |
| timbales | timbales cubaines (timbales) créoles | timbales timbales latino-americani | Timbales |

Never use ambiguous abbreviations: T-T could be either tom-toms or tam-tam. Similarly, sc. means senza corde (without snares) and not suspended cymbal (abbrev. 'susp. cym.').

### Labelling Instrument Entries

Frequent labelling is essential in order to see immediately which instruments are required when returning to any given point during rehearsal.

For instruments of indefinite pitch, once an instrument has been labelled it can be identified by its stave position. However, frequent labelling is important in a playing part — a player cannot be expected to remember the location of every instrument from stave to stave. Every piece has a unique layout and in the course of a concert a player may encounter many different stave positions for the same instrument.

#### PLAYING PART AND PLAYING SCORE

The position of instrument labels depends on the complexity of the set-up.

When a player is to alternate a number of instruments at one time, it is clearest to label each instrument beside its first entry. (This is provided that instrument alternations do not occur so frequently that labels beside each entry clutter the passage.) This includes a new instrument that joins an existing set-up:

[musical example]

When there is frequent interplay between a group of instruments, label them all at the start of each system, to be clear of the passage-work.

It is acceptable to use both types of labelling in the same piece according to the frequency of alternating instruments.

When a part requires no player number (e.g. a single-player percussion part), then labels may be placed in the margin.

#### FULL SCORE

Place labels either beside the respective percussion entries, or at the beginning of each system, page or double-page spread. The greater the number of instruments, the more helpful it is to have frequent labelling.

### LABELLING INSTRUMENT AND STICK CHANGES

In a full score, place instrument and stick changes beside the first entry to which they apply.

In a part, it is helpful to place instructions for changes ('take...' and 'to...') at the first available rest, to allow maximum time for the changes. (This is unnecessary for a short rest, as the player will readily see the new instrument label.) When many rests intervene before the new instrument entry, restate the instrument (or stick) change at the new entry:

[musical example]

### Using Symbols

The use of pictorial symbols for instrument and stick labelling is potentially ambiguous, since many of the symbols that have been recommended in orchestration books are open to different interpretations. The symbols vary from user to user: the symbol ® may be one composer's gong and another's rim shot. During a performance players do not have time to work out what they mean, nor can they be expected to remember which is which in a particular piece. To avoid ambiguity, use words.

If sticks are designated, use words for these as well, as stick diagrams tend to be too small to read from a distance.

## Tuned Percussion

### Octave Transpositions

Use as few ledger lines as possible for percussion music — consider how far players may be from their music stands. Retain ledger lines for the occasional note, but use octave signs for a passage that would otherwise involve many ledger lines.

For this very reason, glockenspiel and crotales should be written two octaves lower than sounding, with the xylophone one octave lower than sounding. However, as these instruments are occasionally written at pitch, or the glockenspiel one octave (rather than two octaves) lower than sounding, clarify the pitch of the part with a clef showing the transposition:

[musical example]

Alternatively, state the written octave with the instrument list at the outset.

### Clefs and Key Signatures

Instruments whose notation fits comfortably in one clef should stay in the one clef. The metal-bar instruments (glockenspiel and vibraphone) should always use the treble clef, since their lowest written notes are only a fourth and fifth respectively below middle C. Instruments that additionally encompass a lower range may change into the bass clef as necessary.

Key signatures may be used for all tuned percussion, especially if this will save writing many accidentals. However, in some circumstances, a key signature may be omitted from a percussion part for practical reasons.

A key signature must be added if a treble or bass clef is introduced for a new instrument after a non-pitched percussion clef.

### Number of Staves for One Player

If possible, use a single stave for a succession of different tuned percussion. The more vertically compact the layout of the part is, the faster the player can read it. Use a second stave only when notation on one stave would be confusing, e.g. when there is a fast interchange between different pitched instruments. The higher-pitched instrument appears on the upper stave:

[musical example]

### Keyboard Percussion

#### NUMBER OF STAVES FOR ONE INSTRUMENT

Use a single stave for one instrument, as this is the most compact layout.

A marimba part that exploits the large compass of the instrument (thus requiring clef changes) should use two staves, to give a better visual indication of the distance between the notes (the lowest octave is about 60 cm / two feet long!). The part may interchange one and two staves as necessary, although in solo music it may be better to use two staves throughout, provided that there can be convenient page-turns.

When a part on two staves is a single melodic line — either for a single instrument (e.g. marimba) or for two or more tuned percussion — it is acceptable to write it as a single line of rhythm, and use rests only when they are part of that rhythm.

#### DAMPING

The vibraphone has a damper pedal. To indicate notes are to be sustained in the pedal, use the same notation as for the piano: the symbol *Ped.* or *Ped.*, placed below the stave. The stylised sign has the advantage of being most conspicuous, as it stands out from other text instructions. As in piano music, it is only necessary to indicate essential or unconventional pedalling.

Tubular bells are fitted with a damping mechanism, although they are usually written with some degree of residual resonance (l.v.) in mind. Should damping be required, use the same notation as for piano and vibraphone (even though in older-style models all the tubes are damped when the damper pedal is depressed). Modern models have a damper pedal that is depressed in order to let the bells resonate. However, this pedal may be deactivated so that all notes can resonate.

On vibraphone and tubular bells, individual notes may be damped by hand.

#### VIBRAPHONE VIBRATO

The vibraphone motor produces a vibrato, and on some instruments the speed of this can be varied: slow/medium/fast vibrato, etc. The use of vibrato is indicated motor on or con vibrato; if vibrato is not required, this is indicated motor off or senza vibrato.

### Tremolos

#### SINGLE-NOTE TREMOLOS

These must be written with tremolo strokes and not with the trill sign. Tuned percussion trills (with the exception of timpani) will be taken to mean trilling with the upper neighbouring note.

#### CHORD TREMOLOS

The percussion convention is to write two-note (or two-chord) tremolos as single chords. This notation is more concise than writing the notes or chords separately, as would be the case for other instruments:

[musical example]

If tremolos should be measured, then the rhythm of the first beat should be notated in full.

## Instruments of Indefinite Pitch

### Using the Five-Line Stave or Line Notation

Notate instruments of indefinite pitch on either a conventional five-line stave or on one to three lines. Since a percussionist is used to reading the five-line stave, a stave of either four lines or more than five is difficult to read and should not be used.

The most appropriate layout often depends on context. In an orchestral or percussion ensemble full score, single lines clearly differentiate instruments of indefinite pitch from surrounding staves of pitched instruments. Single lines also save vertical space. A layout of three instruments on a conventional stave becomes three separate lines:

[musical example]

Notation on lines is preferable for one or two instruments.

For a multiple-instrument part, players prefer notation on one five-line stave.

### Clefs on the Five-Line Stave

The treble and bass clef are used only for tuned instruments; do not use them for instruments of indefinite pitch (as in older editions) as this falsely implies definite pitch. Instead use a clef of two lines (the 'percussion clef') that 'cancels' any assumed pitch.

The percussion clef is placed in the middle two stave-spaces and applies to any notehead on the stave. To indicate the positions of given instruments amongst a group, define their stave positions with small noteheads in advance of their first entries:

[musical example]

In a full score, tiny percussion clefs may be placed on the relevant line or space to define the position of each instrument. However, these are too small to be of use in a part at the distance the player must be from the copy.

### Assigning Instruments to Positions on the Five-Line Stave

Position instruments on the stave according to their relative pitch. Percussionists generally arrange instruments so that the lowest-pitched is on the player's extreme left, the highest-pitched on the far right. (This reflects keyboard arrangement.) In such cases there will be a direct correlation between the notation and the physical set-up.

The precise hierarchy may depend on the musical context and the leading line. An instrument with a leading rhythmic role is clearest to read at the top of the stave.

Allocate one line or space to each instrument so that an instrument in a passage can be identified by its stave position. Do not use the same line or space for more than one instrument.

Place unrelated instruments as far apart on the stave as possible:

[musical example]

#### RELATED INSTRUMENTS

Place two or more of the same instrument on adjacent lines or spaces, or use both lines and spaces if necessary. Separate the position of groups of instruments on the stave. It is also visually helpful to place one group on lines, one group in spaces. Use one or two ledger lines rather than having dissimilar instruments close together in the middle of the stave — when the notation for groups of instruments interlocks, it is impossible to decipher at speed:

[musical example]

When it is intended that different groups of instruments form a particular sequence of relative pitches, arrange them accordingly, but only at the outset of the score and part:

[musical example]

The arrangement on the player's stave must replicate the physical arrangement of instruments (e.g. wood blocks arranged on a single bar) by separating the groups visually (as in the wood block and tom-tom example above).

Should it be useful to number instruments, label the lowest as '1'.

### Band Parts and Educational Music

Percussion parts in educational music, show music, rock music, wind band and brass band music use the five-line stave. Position instruments on the stave according to their relative pitches. The stave position of instruments is usually that of the drumkit (see below).

#### STANDARD DRUMKIT

This always uses the five-line stave. There is no absolute uniformity, but the most standard positions on the stave are:

[musical example]

Tom-tom set-ups are as follows:

[musical example]

Other instruments are usually placed at the top of the stave. (Note that a kit part is essentially a guide and is unlikely to contain as much detail as the layout above provides.)

Some editions reverse the position of hi-hat and ride cymbals. However, the advantage of placing the hi-hat above the top line is that it is often the leading part, and crossed noteheads are most legible above the line.

The closed hi-hat uses the '+' sign after an open note (but is otherwise unnecessary). Above a tied note the '+' sign indicates closing the hi-hats without striking — i.e. the action alone of the footpedal.

A drumkit part is usually written in two-part notation, although simplified to a single part when instruments are not playing together. A cymbal line normally takes separate stems since crossed notes are most visible on their own stems and since this line usually has independent rhythms:

[musical example]

Labelling: it is usual to give a diagram of the drum positions on the stave at the beginning or end of the music, and only to label the entrance of an unusual instrument during the course of a piece.

### Crossed Noteheads

Jazz and rock music notation has a convention of using crossed noteheads for cymbals (sometimes diamond-shaped notes for minims — although combining the different notehead shapes is not recommended). This is so that the cymbal can be distinguished easily from the rest of the kit notes (the cymbal frequently has the most intricate part).

In any other context, crossed noteheads may be used to distinguish specific instrument entries graphically. In a multiple-instrument part they alert the player to a change of instrument in a fast, complex passage. Picking out an instrument in the middle of the stave with a crossed notehead is visually very helpful:

[musical example]

When instruments of definite and indefinite pitch are played together or closely follow one another, a crossed notehead is essential to distinguish an instrument of indefinite pitch on a five-line stave.

A succession of crossed noteheads is much more difficult to read (being less solid) than ordinary noteheads, and so should be used sparingly. In jazz and rock music, repeat-bar signs (%) save a part with many crossed notes from looking too fussy.

Crossed notes should not have more than one function in a work or their use will be confusing.

### Line Notation

#### CLEFS

It is not necessary to include the percussion clef with line notation, since there is no assumed pitch to cancel. However, it is used in some editions.

#### NOTEHEADS ON LINES, SPACES OR BOTH

The layout principles are the same as on a five-line stave.

Each instrument should take a separate line or space. It is not a good idea to have successive instruments on one line; it is better to warn the player of the entry of another instrument by adding another line. When all instruments are placed exclusively on lines or in spaces, the visual difference between them is more marked than when notes are placed on both lines and spaces:

[musical example]

#### LINE SPACING
Two or three lines are easiest to read if spaced more widely than normal. However, notes placed in spaces are clearest to read when the lines are a conventional stave-space apart, as the noteheads fit the whole space.

#### STEM DIRECTION (PART FOR ONE PLAYER)
A single-instrument part on one line may take either stem direction. Grace notes take up-stems, regardless of the prevailing stem direction. Up-stems have the advantage that articulation and dynamics are then placed together below the line, and tuplet indications above the stems are clear of dynamics:

[musical example]

In a score all players with parts on a single line take the same stem direction.

When a player has two or more lines, stems may point into the middle of the group of lines, as they would do on a five-line stave.

#### PLACING RESTS

Centre each rest around the middle space or on the middle line:

[musical example]

When there are multiple lines, place a rest that is part of a beat on a horizontal level with adjacent notes. Place other rests at the centre of the group of lines.

### Multiple-Instrument Part (One Player)

By far the best layout is one five-line stave, even if this entails placing notes on one or two ledger lines to create sufficient lines for the required instruments. Players are most used to reading the five-line stave, and other configurations will, therefore, prove more problematic.

The five-line stave is vertically compact and thus quicker to read than a group of widely spaced lines. A part becomes harder to read the greater the depth of the system. A solution that reduces the number of lines to a minimum is not easier to read should the notehead positions be difficult to distinguish.

When one five-line stave is insufficient for the number of instruments being used, introduce a second stave. Alternatively, create additional lines above or below the stave, separating them from the stave for visual clarity.

Given the above guidelines, provide sufficient staves (or additional lines) for there to be as many lines and spaces as instruments in a given passage. Thus the player can recognize each instrument from its position within the group. Do not move instruments onto fewer lines in order to save space, as this is confusing: players become accustomed to the unique layout of a piece. Only for an extended passage using fewer instruments, or a different group of instruments, is it acceptable to omit a group of lines.

[TABLE 1: Example of comparative layouts for multiple-instrument part]

#### MULTIPLE-INSTRUMENT PART AS A SINGLE LINE OF RHYTHM

Notate multiple instruments as a single line of rhythm wherever possible, so that:

- the notes of all instruments played simultaneously join to one stem
- beams join the beats together
- the part requires only one set of dynamics (dynamics for individual instruments are used where necessary)
- the part requires only one set of rests, making the music simpler to read

#### SUSTAINED-LINE PART (ONE PLAYER)

Overlapping sustained notes on different instruments should take separate stems and rests. Reverse the stems away from each other. At such a point that each instrument does not need a separate stem, join the parts into a single line of rhythm:

[musical example]

When there are more than two sustained parts, two stems must be placed in the same direction:

[musical example]

The same principles apply to the notation of tuned instruments.

### Defining Specific and Non-Specific Pitch

Instruments that are normally regarded as tuned are sometimes used without specific pitches. The outset of the score and part should therefore state this; e.g. '4 gongs, non-specific pitches: high, medium, low and very low'. The gongs are then notated as instruments of indefinite pitch.

A composer may wish to specify pitches for instruments that are frequently notated as indefinitely pitched, but which do also have specific pitches (e.g. cowbells and roto-toms). State the required pitches at the front of the score and part:

[musical example]

It is preferable to present the part without the specified pitches (the extra information involved in reading the pitches is of no relevance to the percussionist playing three similar instruments):

[musical example]

The full score may notate the true pitches for the benefit of the score-reader.

## Layout of Instruments of Definite and Indefinite Pitch for One Player

When instruments of definite and indefinite pitch alternate, use one five-line stave, to keep the layout compact.

Place the percussion clef before the entry of an instrument of indefinite pitch. Note that if treble clefs show octave transpositions, they should be cancelled when transpositions no longer apply.

When pitched and non-pitched instruments occur together or in immediate juxtaposition it is often possible to notate both on one five-line stave. Use crossed noteheads for the instruments of indefinite pitch, to clarify which are without pitch. Place the crossed noteheads outside the stave: above the stave for instruments relatively higher than the tuned percussion; below the stave for instruments relatively lower. Use ledger lines if necessary, to create spaces for different instruments.

When two (or more) different instruments play consecutively, only one set of rests is necessary. Two instruments playing together require opposite stem directions:

[musical example]

When a combined-instrument part would be unclear on a single stave, place instruments of indefinite pitch on a separate line or group of lines above or below the five-line stave. Where possible, preserve the single-rhythm part, as one rhythm is far easier to read:

[musical example]

## Two Players on One Stave

In a wind band and brass band full score, it is acceptable (and a convention) for two percussionists playing instruments of indefinite pitch to have their parts notated on a single stave, to save space. It is not a usual convention in an orchestral score, or in orchestral parts, so is best avoided unless space is very limited.

When two players share a stave, the player of the upper part takes up-stems, the player of the lower part takes down-stems. (Notes for two players should always be stemmed separately, since two noteheads on one stem would imply that one player plays two instruments.)

For clarity, place instruments for the up-stemmed player at the top of the stave, instruments for the down-stemmed player at the bottom of the stave. Allocate dynamics for each player. Identical rests may be shared:

[musical example]

To save further space in a score, the notes for the two players may be placed either side of a single line:

[musical example]

Players should not share a notehead, since, in percussion writing, a note with two stems means that one instrument is struck with two sticks.

## Note Duration

### Role of Articulation

A variety of articulation marks such as staccato dots, tenuto lines and accents may be used to convey relative weights of touch more economically than constantly shifting dynamic markings. For isolated strokes, allocate such markings only when an instrument is capable of differentiating staccato, tenuto or accented attacks from notes without marked articulation.

### Duration for Dry Instruments

Instruments with no sustaining power (xylophone, claves, wood blocks, high drums, etc.) should take note lengths that are convenient to read — do not attempt to reflect their brevity by using short notes that make rhythms look difficult:

[musical example]

A staccato dot should not be used to indicate that a note has a naturally short duration.

### Long-Reverberating Instruments

It is very important to indicate whether the notes of long-reverberating instruments should be sustained only for their written duration or whether the sound should be left to die away naturally. Unless otherwise indicated, instruments will be damped at the first written rest (or as soon as practicable thereafter). Instruments that should be left to ring indefinitely need to be indicated l.v. (laissez vibrer; 'let ring'), or with an open tie.

An extended passage of notes left to ring is indicated l.v. sempre. (Numerous open ties clutter the music unnecessarily.) For short passages, it is equally acceptable to use open ties for each note:

[musical example]

When an instrument that has been sustained with a roll is left to ring, it is essential to use an open tie or l.v. instruction. To notate the duration of the laissez vibrer with note-values might suggest that the first and subsequent tied notes should be re-articulated as necessary to preserve the continuous sound:

[musical example]

## Damping

When each note is notated for its full duration damping indications are not required. (The player will damp at the indicated rest.) If deemed necessary, an instruction at the front of the score and part makes this unambiguous: 'all instruments are written with their full resonating length and should be damped at the indicated rest'.

When several instruments played in a single passage are to be damped at different times, it may become visually too complex to notate the full length of all durations. Instead, write the passage as a single-rhythm part and place an open tie or l.v. indication after each instrumental entry or at the end of the passage. A rest is required only to complete the value of a bar (a rest for each instrument would merely add unwanted extra information):

[musical example]

Damping instructions may be given in words, or with a sign // (or, less commonly, ø) placed at the precise point where the instrument is to be damped. Divide rests for this if necessary.

To indicate where to damp once the player has moved to another instrument, give a verbal instruction above the stave (below the stave if more visually helpful — e.g. when damping lower notes on the stave). This is simpler to read than writing the full length of long-sustaining notes. State which instrument is to be damped when others have been played in the interim:

[musical example]

### Finger (or Hand) Damping

#### NOTATED IN RHYTHM

The notation of finger damping should be reserved for very special effects. Usually it is left to the individual player to clarify the texture. To make the musical intention clear, where possible add phrase marks rather than use extra finger-damping notation (which can add a significant layer of complexity).

When each note is to be damped individually at a specific point in the bar, place crossed noteheads at the relevant pitches or on the relevant line or space:

[musical example]

Although this notation is often reserved for tuned percussion, it may also be used for the consecutive damping of several instruments. Such notation is efficient as it shows exactly where the player must damp each instrument — when all notes take full duration, the notation may become too complicated:

[musical example]

An instruction must clarify that the notation shows finger damping, since, for example, a cymbal could be struck while being simultaneously damped.

#### IMMEDIATE DAMPING

The written instruction secco (Italian, 'dry') or etouffez (French, 'damp') indicates immediate damping. Additionally, staccato dots may be added. In order to make the rhythms simplest to read it is better to use staccato dots rather than very short durations:

[musical example]

The role of the staccato dot may be ambiguous without a damping instruction, as it can also be used interpretatively.

### Stick Damping

Stick damping ('dead sticking') is a technique in which the player stops a stick from rebounding by holding it against the instrument's surface. It is useful to differentiate noteheads of such strokes. The notation .D used by Kagel in Match is economical.

Notes may take staccato dots, but whatever notation is used must be clarified with a verbal instruction.

## Sticks, Beaters and Mallets

Unless otherwise indicated, the player will choose the most appropriate sticks for the musical result demanded by the score. Therefore indicate sticks only for a special effect. To return to normal sticks use norm. bat. or ord., or ordinary sticks, etc.

Place stick indications above the stave, after instrument labels.

### STICK ALLOCATION BETWEEN HANDS

Indicating stick allocation is usually neither necessary nor desirable: players will work out their preferred distribution between the hands. Therefore give all notes played together a single stem:

[musical example]

Two stems should be used to indicate that two sticks are used together on one instrument (this special effect aggressively dulls the sound):

[musical example]

## Tremolos, Rolls and Trills

### Single-Note Rolls

The concept of the unmeasured tremolo is that it is without perceptible rhythmic stress. Percussionists are highly skilled at executing very fast measured rolls: an unmeasured roll may actually be played more slowly. The measured tremolo is more pronounced and very rhythmic in effect, quite different from the unmeasured roll. For this reason the notation should be differentiated.

The measured roll should initially be written out in full. The unmeasured roll is indicated trem. (alternatively, add a further tremolo stroke, as long as this ensures that the roll cannot be measured in the given speed):

[musical example]

Rolls are often written as trills. (In drum parts a trill always means a roll on a single drum.) This notation has the advantage of showing unambiguously that a roll is unmeasured. However, in general, percussionists prefer the trill sign to be reserved for the true two-note trills of tuned percussion.

### Two-Note Rolls

It is recommended that the two-note roll between two instruments, including timpani, is written as a chord. This is the same principle as the notation of tuned percussion tremolos.

Historically, the two-note roll was written as a two-note tremolo, but this may be interpreted as a more deliberately rhythmic, measured tremolo between the different pitches:

[musical example]

If necessary, to clarify the notation, add a footnote at the first appearance such as 'tremolo chords signify two-note unmeasured rolls'.

### Unbroken Rolls

All the note-values of an unbroken roll take solid ties:

[musical example]

(Dotted ties may be used but are visually more difficult to read.)

The older-style notation of omitting ties for the unbroken roll should not be used:

[musical example]

If the roll requires slight separation between bars, mark articulation for the respective notes.

A roll punctuated with accents will remain unbroken where ties are used:

[musical example]

## Beating Spots (Striking Points)

Different locations on an instrument's surface can be indicated in words: e.g. at the edge, on the rim, dome, centre, etc. Arrows indicate the transition between one beating spot and another:

[musical example]

Alternatively, for instruments of indefinite pitch, noteheads may be placed on different lines or spaces to represent different locations:

[musical example]

If multiple lines are already required (i.e. for a multiple-instrument part), the example above will be impractical. In such a case use only a single line, add verbal instructions for the different locations (as in the first example above) and notate 'playing on the rim' with a crossed notehead. Add a verbal definition for the crossed notehead at its first appearance, or at the outset.

### RIM SHOTS
Rim shots are always marked out with differentiated noteheads (the crossed notehead should not be used for a rimshot if it is already being used to indicate playing on the rim):

[musical example]

## Timpani

Individual players will have different sizes of drums. Therefore it is not always possible to be absolutely specific as to how many drums are required, as individual instruments may have slightly different ranges. However, when a sequence will require a minimum number of drums, a description is useful at the outset of the score and part. This might read:

"at least 5 drums tuned to the following pitches: [musical example]"

It is useful to state when a high drum (the piccolo timpano) is needed:

"4 drums including the pitch: [musical example]"

### KEY SIGNATURES

Most timpani music does not include key signatures. The player is used to seeing accidentals before the respective notes.

### TUNING INDICATIONS

Initial tunings may be indicated at the start of a piece:

"tunings: [musical example]"

Indication of re-tunings should be left to the player.

### GLISSANDOS
Two distinct glissando techniques are differentiated by their notation.

Glissando after the note is struck: the slur indicates that the final note of the glissando is not re-articulated:

[musical example]

Rolled glissando: the duration of each glissando is notated (and articulated) with tremolo strokes:

[musical example]

## Drum Notation

### GRACE-NOTE SLURS FOR DRUM STROKES

Slurs indicate that notes are played by the same hand, as rebounding strokes before the beat. Such bounced notes are called 'closed strokes': the notes are crushed in immediately before the beat.

Grace-note groups without slurs are played with alternate sticks, hand to hand, giving more defined articulation before the beat. These are called 'open strokes':

[musical example]

Do not use a slur between a single grace note and a following measured note, because the strokes are played with different hands.

### MUFFLING OR MUTING

Cloth or felt is placed on the drumhead to dampen reverberations, in order to deaden the sound. This is indicated by muffled or coperto (plural coperti; Italian, 'covered') and cancelled by unmuffled or scoperto (plural scoperti).

### SNARE (SIDE) DRUM INDICATIONS

The instruction for snare drum is with snares (Italian: con corde); this is cancelled by without snares (Italian: senza corde). When snares are used for an entire piece, this may be indicated at the outset as with snares throughout — or con corde sempre. (This is not usually necessary, as with snares is assumed to be the norm.)

### FINGER PLAYING

All drums can be played with the fingers or flat of hand. This is indicated with verbal instructions: with fingers, with palm, etc.

## Cymbals

### LABELLING
When suspended and clashed cymbals occur in the same piece, it must be clear which is which. Clashed cymbals are labelled cyms. (pair) or cyms. a 2, suspended cymbal abbreviated to susp. cym.

### ROLLS

Tremolos are usually played on the suspended cymbal. The rarely used two-plate roll is indicated by a 2 and uses the same notation:

[musical example]

Hi-hat (or high-hat) cymbals are mounted on a stand with a footpedal and operate in closed (pedal depressed) and open (pedal up) positions. The notation is:

HI-HAT NOTATION

O = open (ringing tone)
+ = damped or choked
O = half open

Note that in rock music the '+' sign is commonly used to mean playing slightly open hi-hats, so that the cymbals sizzle together.

Jazz and rock music uses crossed noteheads for cymbals.

### STRIKE WHILE DAMPING
A plus sign may also indicate that any suspended cymbal (i.e. not just the hi-hat) is clamped with one hand while being struck with a stick held in the other. A verbal instruction is required at first appearance, such as strike while damping:

[musical example]

## Symbols to Express Special Techniques

The player needs to know the rhythmic placing and duration of a sound, but should not be expected to be conversant with symbols that attempt to illustrate how to play an instrument. This applies equally whether the notation is for a conventional percussion stroke or an action that requires an individual instruction such as crumpling paper into a ball or breaking a bottle against a tin plate.

Avoid elaborate symbols, as they clutter the stave, and it takes time to work out what they mean. Where a symbol will save a lengthy instruction, use the simplest possible notation:

[musical example]

(The arrows indicate to and fro sweeps — as opposed to strokes in one direction only)

A tremolo may indicate the duration of a note to be sustained in an unconventional way (and a verbal instruction qualify the technique). Indicate the type of stroke to be used (scrape, brush, rub, etc.) so that the tremolo beams are not interpreted as repeated strokes:

[musical example]

If more appropriate (e.g. to indicate an amalgam of sounds), a trill line placed mid-system may indicate continuing sound.

However, it is often best to use conventional note-values, so as to clarify duration at a glance.

A different symbol may be used where tremolo strokes might be misleading, as long as the symbol has clear explanation:

[musical example]

### Bowed Notes

These should be indicated with a written instruction beside the relevant notes; do not give bow direction (↑ ↓), as this makes no difference to the sound.

### Tambourine

Specify a tambourine technique only when there is a requirement to play a passage in an unconventional way. Indicate the instruction verbally, over the note: shaken, thumb roll, palm, etc.
