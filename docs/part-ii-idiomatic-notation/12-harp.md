# 12. Harp

## General Notation

While general notational principles of keyboard music apply to the harp, the technical demands of the instrument are so different that certain pianistic conventions should be avoided. These are outlined below.

Most instrumentalists can play by touch alone, which allows the player to read the music uninterrupted. The harpist, though, has constantly to check the position of pitches by referring to the coloured strings of the instrument. For this reason it is important not to overload the music with more details than the player can assimilate in the time available.

### Distributing Notes Between the Staves

In general the right hand plays the higher notes, the left hand the lower notes. The left hand must play the lowest strings, as the right hand cannot reach them. (Exactly how low the right hand can reach depends on the stretch of the individual player and the design of the instrument.)

Notes should be placed on the staves to show the musical sense as clearly as possible — more like a score than a keyboard part. Place treble-range notes on the upper stave, lower notes on the lower stave. Thus when the pitches for both hands are close together, place them together on the same stave. Do not arrange such notes on separate staves for each hand (see example below); the harpist prefers to see a direct relationship between the arrangement of notes on the two staves and their position on the instrument. Presenting notes in the same range on one stave means that it is easy for the player to rearrange hand distribution if required.

When a passage of close-position chords has even numbers of notes, divide the notes equally between the hands. The notes for each hand take separate stems:

[musical example]

(Where one or both hands requires two stem directions, it is, obviously, necessary to allocate the notes for each hand a separate stave.)

For extended passage-work of predominantly single-line writing, the part should not attempt to distribute notes between the hands unless there is an obvious hand allocation: instead, players prefer to work out their own choreography. Do not allow pitches to overlap on opposite staves, as might be notated in keyboard music, unless absolutely necessary. This is very confusing for the player, who will have to rewrite the part before it can be played:

[musical example]

## The Tuning Mechanism

There are seven pedals, each of which controls a pitch of the scale in every octave. They can each be set to one of three positions: ♭, ♮ or ♯.

The pedal settings do not affect the top G and bottom D and C strings. These strings must be pre-tuned independently to one setting (♭, ♮ or ♯) for an entire piece or movement (see Scordatura, p. 388).

### Principle of Including Pedal Settings

Pedal settings should be worked out and indicated throughout a piece, even though a harpist may rearrange these for greater convenience. Some harpists may want to work out their own pedal changes, but it is better to provide a part that shows that the pedal arrangements are technically viable. This will make it apparent that the composer is aware of the technical demands being placed on the player.

(See Pedal settings, p. 375.)

## Note-Spelling

The spelling of pitches is critical because enharmonically equivalent notes are played on different strings. Spell all notes to agree with the pedal settings, regardless of tonality or chromatic voice-leading.

Double sharps and double flats should never be used, as such notes do not exist as pedal settings.

Chords should not be written to look as if a string requires two different pedal positions simultaneously:

[musical example]

An exception to this approach to note-spelling is the use of tonal configurations such as large chords or arpeggios: these are easier to read as enharmonically correct entities, regardless of the pedal setting. (A harpist may perform quick pedal changes, if necessary, in order to have the convenience of playing such chords and arpeggios as standard learnt figures.)

[musical example]

A passage should be written enharmonically to minimise pedal movements, even within a tonal context. The following passage can be arranged so that it needs no pedal changes (a); it should not be left requiring athletic pedal changes (b):

[musical example]

### Alternating Strings

Spell notes to be played on alternate strings according to the pedal settings:

[musical example]

Harp strings sound to best advantage in their ♭ positions, where the string is at its longest length and vibrates most fully (see Bartok extract, p. 354). Notes to be played in this way should be written as flats.

[musical example]

Where a full score exists independently of a playing part, it should match the note-spelling used for the part.

### Key Signatures

Passages of enharmonically altered note-spelling may make little sense of an existing key signature. The key signature can be omitted altogether, or a more relevant one substituted. The following passage in the key of B major takes a C♭ major key signature:

Bartok: Concerto for Orchestra

[musical example]

### Note Clusters

Note clusters should be written as chords comprising the relevant strings and not as clusters, since each hand can play only four notes at a time. (Larger chords must be strummed: see Chord glissandos (Strumming), p. 360.)

[musical example]

A written cluster should be used only for a special technique in which the hand slaps the strings with an open palm. This technique requires a verbal instruction at its first appearance:

[musical example]

(For notation of Note Clusters, see p. 326.)

## Pedal Settings

The notation for pedal settings reflects the physical layout of the pedals:

Each pitch is spelled with an accidental, even when this requires writing seven natural signs. (Harpists tune strings in their ♭ position and therefore, for instance, an F string does not equal F♮.) Left-foot pedals appear on the left:

D♭ C♭ B♭
E♭ F♭ G♭ A♭
|--|
left foot  right foot

Arranged on two lines, right-foot pedals go above left-foot ones. Stack the pedals directly above one another, as harpists are adept at changing a string with each foot simultaneously:

E♭ F♮ G♯ A♭
D♮ C♯ B♭

Some players prefer the left-foot pedal arrangement to be written B-C-D, to reflect the changing of pedals by alternative feet working out from the centre (E then B, F, C, etc.).

Harpists themselves frequently use a diagram to indicate the position of the pedal notches because this is faster to assimilate than pitch names. The horizontal line represents the ♭ position:

[musical example]

It is best to leave such diagrams for players to write in, according to their own preferences.

Individual pedal changes (i.e. less than a complete seven-note layout) are indicated by pitch name, even when a diagram represents a complete layout.

### Pedal Settings and Accidentals

Indicating pedal settings does not obviate the need for an accidental to be placed in front of each relevant pitch in the normal way. Cautionary accidentals are useful, as for any other instrument, even though once a pedal is set in a given position (♭, ♮ or ♯), no octave of that pitch can play anything else. As well as indicating the pedal changes, an accidental should be cancelled in the usual way.

### Placing Pedal Settings

Ideally, place the pedal settings mid-system so that there can be no doubt as to which system they refer. If possible, position the staves sufficiently far apart for there to be room for the harpist to write in personal preferences for the settings as well. It is a big advantage for the player to have all necessary information contained within the system. If there is no room mid-system (e.g. a passage has double-stemmed beams), place a complete pedal setting above the system, and individual pitch-name settings below.

Some harpists like to see the pedal settings just before an entry, others at the first available rest once the strings have stopped vibrating after a previous passage. Given that a player looks ahead, it is best to place pedal settings at the following entry, especially after a page-turn.

### Giving Complete Pedal Settings

It is essential to give a complete pedal setting at the beginning of a piece, movement or new section, and before a glissando (see Glissandos, p. 377).

In rehearsal, players need to be able to switch quickly between sections. It is therefore very helpful to add complete settings frequently: at rehearsal marks, after rest periods and at the top of a new page.

### Individual Pedal Changes

To indicate an individual pedal change, give the pitch letter and its new accidental. For example, when the B pedal in the ♭ position changes to ♮, write B♮, never B♭-B♮ (see following example). Place the indications mid-system, right foot above left foot if stacked.

The harpist will leave a vibrating string as long as possible before a pedal change so that the altered pitch does not sound unintentionally. Whenever possible, reflect this by placing the pedal setting where it is sensible to change it. If time allows, indicate a pedal change before or after (and not during) a dramatic silence, as the mechanics of pedal changing are relatively noisy in a small hall or recording studio.

To indicate that the foot does not leave a particular pedal for consecutive retunings, extend a line between pedal accidentals (this technical information is left to the player to mark unless it is a particularly tricky manoeuvre):

[musical example]

Note that such a line does not in itself indicate a pedal glissando (see Pedal glissandos, p. 359).

### Pedal Settings in a Full Score

Where a full score exists independently of a playing part, it need not contain pedal settings. The only exception is to show the pitches of a glissando (see Glissandos, below).

## Playing Style of Chords

If there is no instruction, players will judge according to context whether or not to spread chords. Therefore indicate where a particular style is intended. Give either a general instruction or individual ones, beside chords or passages as required (see Performance instructions, p. 491).

Where chords should not be rolled, indicate this as sempre non arpeggiando (abbrev. arpegg. or arp.).

To roll all chords, indicate this as sempre arpeggiando.

Within a general instruction, any individual chords or passages that contradict it may be marked separately as non arpeggiando (or with a vertical square bracket) and arpeggiando (or with a wavy arpeggio line).

(For notation of Arpeggiated Chords, see p. 131; see also Chord glissandos (Strumming), p. 360.)

## Glissandos

Always give a written-out scale passage an instruction so that the player knows whether to pluck each string individually (non gliss.) or not (gliss.). A measured glissando must be notated as a scale in the required rhythm (a); a repeated pattern may be abbreviated after stating the initial glissando (b):

[musical example]

For an unmeasured glissando, give the starting and finishing notes and connect them with a diagonal line. The starting note takes the full duration of the glissando, when this is possible in one note-value. Otherwise it makes up the value of a bar, half-bar or beat (see following example; see also Glissandos: Durations of more than one note-value, p. 145).

Provide a complete pedal setting for a glissando, and for each new glissando that has a different pedal setting. The harpist must know the intended setting of every pedal: do not assume pedals are set as required from a previous passage, as the player may have rearranged them.

Where space allows in the player's part, it is useful to indicate the first octave of glissando pitches, as well as the pedal settings. (It is unnecessary to give both in a full score.) The octave of pitches is best notated as stemless small notes. It is helpful if each note without a flat or sharp takes a natural sign. Glissando pitches are sometimes written as an octave of stemmed notes, beamed together, but this might suggest that the notes are separately fingered (i.e. non gliss.). A glissando in each hand needs an indication of the pitches in one hand only (bar 4):

[musical example]

### Parallel-chord Glissandos

Each note of the chord takes a separate glissando line. Indicate an octave of pitches as a series of chords until at least all pitches are covered:

[musical example]

### Continuous Sweeps

A glissando line can reflect any required contour. An arrow at the end of the glissando line indicates reaching an unspecified note (a); to be more prescriptive, indicate a pitch at the end of each glissando peak or trough (b):

[musical example]

(See also Glissandos: To and from unspecified pitches, p. 142.)

### Glissandos with Clef Changes

When it is necessary to change clef during the course of a glissando, place the new clef mid-way through the glissando. Where practical, use ledger-line notes rather than a change of clef (bar 2):

[musical example]

(See also Glissandos: With Clef Changes, p. 142.)

Many glissando techniques are possible on the harp. These are best specified with verbal instructions where they occur. In his Modern Study of the Harp (G. Schirmer, 2nd edn, 1948), Carlos Salzedo catalogues and suggests appropriate notation for many glissando techniques.

### Pedal Glissandos

Once a string has been plucked, it is caught or released by the pedal mechanism in order to change the pitch. To notate this, place a glissando line between the two pitches and slur them to show that the second note is not plucked. Add the instruction ped. gliss. at first appearance and extend a line between the pedal settings:

[musical example]

### Chord Glissandos (Strumming)

An adjacent-string chord may be strummed, rather than arpeggiated with separate fingers, for a rapid glissando. An arrow above or in front of the chord indicates this. The arrow shows the direction of the strum:

Bartok: Concerto for Orchestra

[musical example]

(See also example Hand damping in rhythm, p. 365.)

To indicate unmeasured strumming, use tremolo notation:

[musical example]

Without indicating arrows it is still likely that the harpist will strum chords at a loud dynamic. For a quiet dynamic a chord marked with tremolo strokes is played bisbigliando, i.e. not strummed (see below).

## Tremolos and Bisbigliando

The term bisbigliando (Italian, 'whispering'; abbrev. bisbigl. or bisb.) indicates an unmeasured rapid tremolo between two or more strings played quietly in the middle and upper registers of the harp.

The group of notes is best written as a tremolo chord, rather than as individual rhythms, even though each note will be played separately. Only one stem is necessary, even though the harpist will (most likely) use both hands. A bisbigliando passage will be played by alternating both hands, if both are free to do so.

All passages to be played in this way should be labelled bisbigliando, so that the harpist does not attempt to measure the notes or chords in rhythm nor to interpret the tremolo as the repetition (or alternation) of blocked chords:

[musical example]

When the player is required to apply this technique to alternating chords as opposed to single notes, allocate a separate chord for each hand. It is unnecessary to place the chords on two staves, although this is sometimes used (c). Place the tremolo beams between the chords (a). Stems may point in opposite directions on the one stave to show hand allocation, although this is not strictly necessary (b):

[musical example]

When both hands play together rather than alternating, place both chords at the beginning of the duration:

[musical example]

When the groups of notes are to be played in a particular direction, place arpeggio lines in front of the chords, with arrows to indicate their direction (if the direction is other than both hands upwards):

[musical example]

A specific order of notes must be written out in full:

[musical example]

It is worth noting that although a prescribed order does slow down the playing, the passage should still be marked bisbigliando to indicate the character of the music.

Single-pitch and single-chord tremolos (see p. 362) should be labelled bisbigliando if this is the required effect.

### Single-Pitch Tremolos

All the notes of the chromatic scale, with the exception of D♮, C♮ and A♯, can be doubled with their enharmonic equivalent on an adjacent string. The alternation of these two strings is written as a tremolo and must indicate both enharmonic notes. Notate the lowest string first, as the harpist will start with this. Both hands (if free) will play both notes in turn, but the tremolo is best notated on one stave only, and with single stems (a). Two stems may be used, but this is unnecessary (b). To notate the literal actions of each hand is also unnecessary (c):

[musical example]

Do not use ordinary single-note tremolo notation for this technique, as this does not show the alternation of two strings:

[musical example]

### Single-Chord Tremolos

As with notation of a single-pitch tremolo, a single-chord tremolo must show the enharmonically equivalent pitches:

[musical example]

## Damping and Laissez Vibrer

The harp is a resonating instrument. While damping must be left to the player's discretion according to what is physically possible, a composition should give specific damping instructions where it is essential to damp, leaving the player in no doubt at any time as to which notes are damped and which are not.

### Laissez Vibrer

To indicate that the strings are left to vibrate, indicate either laissez vibrer (l.v.) or an open tie after the last note(s) of a passage. (Both indications together are unnecessary.)

Where there is to be no damping, give a general instruction: i.e. sempre or leave all strings to ring on. This instruction can be qualified with the words unless otherwise indicated, and individual chords or passages marked to be damped (see Damping instructions, below).

In laissez vibrer passage-work, rather than short notes and rests, use tied notes to show that the line of music is continuous:

[musical example]

(See also Laissez vibrer, p. 72.)

### Damping Instructions

Give a general instruction when resonance should be kept to a minimum: damp in all rests. For an occasional instruction, secco (Italian, 'dry') is a better description for a resonating instrument than staccato; the harpist will then damp to phrase the music, but not necessarily after every note unless the tempo is very slow.

To damp individual strings immediately after they have been played gives a deliberately percussive effect. A staccato wedge on a note indicates this; the player will damp it immediately, if possible:

[musical example]

### Staccato Damping (Sons Étouffés)

Sons étouffés (French, 'damped sounds') involves damping every note before playing the next. The playing hand will usually damp a passage when the intervals are within the scope of the hand span (about a tenth); the other hand must damp a passage involving very wide leaps.

Staccato wedges to each note may accompany the instruction sons étouffés. This emphasizes the mode of playing: harpists are reluctant to damp every note unless each is written as such. To return to normal playing indicate ord., nat. or norm.:

[musical example]

### Hand Damping

Once a phrase is finished, the player's hands are free to damp all resonating strings. (This is the normal playing method unless otherwise indicated.) Individual instructions to damp should use the sign (↓). To indicate damping the strings with both hands, place one sign between the staves. To damp at the beginning of a bar, place the sign just after the barline (bar 4):

[musical example]

If both hands must damp, both need rests. However, in exceptional circumstances, damping signs may replace rests where the use of rests would destroy the sense of musical phrase:

[musical example]

If necessary, use one sign for each hand. Place the sign after the relevant notes exactly where the strings are to be damped. The sign is most conspicuous placed as close to the horizontal level of the previous pitches as possible (but not on the stave):

[musical example]

A damping sign may be attached to the stem of small notes to indicate that individual strings should be damped. Use this notation when it is clearer to notate the notes that are to be damped than those that are to be sustained. In the following examples the small notes take note-values to show the rhythm of the damping. Use opposite stem direction to differentiate the damping instructions from the played notes:

[musical example]

The small notes do not necessarily require rhythmic values; crotchet-stemmed notes can simply be placed exactly where the damping is required. To indicate damping a group of strings, connect the small notes with a diagonal line:

[musical example]

Note that to indicate damping specific strings is often not relevant since it is generally the very lowest strings that hold the resonances; also, the sympathetic vibrations depend on the pedal settings at the time the string is plucked.

## Harmonics

In all cases notate the pitch of the plucked string.

### Octave Harmonics

These should be written an octave below their sounding pitch, since this is the string that is plucked. Each harmonic note requires a small circle to be placed above it. Any note without a circle is played as an ordinary note. Owing to the hand positions, the right hand can play only one harmonic at a time, the left hand up to three in close position:

Colin Matthews: Little Suite for Harp

[musical example]

Although only the octave harmonic is written in this way, it is a good idea to clarify in a preliminary note or in a footnote that a harmonic sounds an octave higher than written. (Harmonics have sometimes been notated at sounding rather than played pitch.)

### Harmonics at the Twelfth and Seventeenth

There is no standard notation to indicate these harmonics; the clearest policy is to notate both the string and the sounding pitch on one stem. Differentiate the two noteheads, writing the sounding pitch as a small note in brackets and the string as an ordinary note with a circle beneath it:

[musical example]

For clarification, the notation should be explained at the outset or at its first appearance.

## Plucking

### Where to Pluck

Plucking closer than normal to the soundboard (table) is indicated près de la table (abbrev. p.d.l.t. or table). Beware of using 'T' for table as a similar symbol is sometimes used to indicate the tuning key. (The tuning key may be placed against or between the strings to produce special effects: see Salzedo, Modern Study of the Harp).

Plucking near the top end of the string is indicated près des chevilles (French, 'near the pegs'; abbrev. p.c.).

Ord., nat. or norm. must cancel both instructions (see example under With the plectrum, below).

### Plucking Techniques

#### With the Fingernail

To pluck or to slide along the string with the fingernail is traditionally indicated in Italian: unghia(e) or con le unghie (with the nails). This verbal instruction is now usually replaced by the symbol Λ or inverted to V over the note. A note without the symbol will be plucked normally. Extend a horizontal bracket when more than one note is to be played in this way:

[musical example]

#### With the Plectrum

For occasional use of a plectrum, place a verbal instruction above the stave. (In the extract from his Concerto for Orchestra, p. 360, Bartok stipulates the material to be used to achieve the required effect.) Where there are already many written instructions, a symbol such as C is simpler to read:

[musical example]

When there is no bracket to enclose the instruction, it should be cancelled by ord., nat. or norm. 

#### Snap Pizzicato

This is written ⊙ or ⊗ (as is the 'Bartok pizzicato' of bowed string instruments). The finger plucks the string près de la table and immediately slaps the same finger against the soundboard (see previous example, last bar).

### Pedal Buzz

To produce the pedal buzz, or clash (if very loud), the pedal is held half-way between two notches when the string is plucked. Notate both pedal settings between which the pedals fall, and place the symbol $ between the settings. The symbol $ may be used when a single string is plucked:

[musical example]

Clarify the symbol with a verbal explanation at its first appearance. (Salzedo calls this technique 'metallic sounds'.) 

## Scordatura

For unconventional tunings, individual strings can be re-tuned in advance of the performance. Tunings for the strings unaffected by the tuning mechanism (the lowest D and C and the highest G string) should be given at the start of a piece or movement: 'tune low D string to D♯.'

Indicate any other re-tuning in the same way (see example below). In the player's part, notate the string that is to be plucked: do not write the sounding pitch as this suggests a different string. In a score, actual concert pitches may be given by pitch name at their first appearance, above or below the stave, to alert the score reader:

[musical example]

Scordatura is most frequently used to create microtonal pitches. Microtonal accidentals should precede the string pitch in a score. They are helpful in a part although not strictly necessary, since once the scordatura is set up the player does not act on this information:

[musical example]

(For notation of microtonal accidentals, see Microtones, p. 94.) 

## Percussive Sounds on Body of Instrument

Fingertips, knuckles and palm can each produce very different sounds on the soundboard and body of the harp. Each technique requires a verbal instruction: with fingertips or tap; with knuckles or knock; with palm or slap. The harpist will exploit the most resonant part of the soundboard unless a particular area is specified.

Either allocate a separate line to notate such techniques, or else use crossed (or other unconventional) noteheads. Assign different areas of the instrument separate lines or spaces. Place the notation mid-system if possible, otherwise above the upper stave:

[musical example]

When the part is particularly complex, different noteheads may differentiate these techniques (rectangular notes are used by Berio in, for example, Sequenza II, and in some harp parts of Takemitsu).

For further reading, see Carlos Salzedo, Modern Study of the Harp, which pioneered many harp techniques. For those techniques not included in this chapter, follow the notation Salzedo uses accompanied by verbal explanations, for clarity. Kurt Stone in his Music Notation in the Twentieth Century comprehensively covers Salzedo's techniques and other more recently defined specialized techniques.
