# 13. Classical Guitar

## General Notation

Guitar music is notated on a single stave in the treble clef, sounding an octave lower than written. This transposed range fits comfortably on the treble stave.

If preferred, the clef é may be used.

Two staves may occasionally be needed to clarify complex part-writing, but should be used only if absolutely essential. Both staves appear in the treble clef and are joined by a curly brace.

### Level of Technical Detail to Include

Printed guitar music usually contains technical information such as string designation, fingering and fret position supplied by a guitarist. The composer should specify strings (and, very occasionally, fingering) for special effects only. The examples below show string and fingering indications as might be supplied by a guitar editor.

## String Designation

The basic tuning for the six strings (and their string numbers) is:

[musical example]

(To notate other tunings, see Scordatura, p. 388.)

The composer may prescribe a certain string if a specific timbre is required; otherwise the player works out string allocation, based on technical considerations as well as the different sounds of each string.

A circle encloses a string number. Place this above or below the stave, according to whichever position is closest to the relevant note. A horizontal line indicates the continuing use of the same string. (A dotted line is recommended for this, so that solid lines can be reserved for other continuation lines that guitar music needs: fret position and right-hand fingering.)

A zero rather than a string number indicates an open-string pitch.

[musical example]

Stack numerals above a chord if there is room to do so (a); where there is little spare vertical space, numerals may encroach onto the stave, although they then become less legible (b):

[musical example]

## Right-Hand Fingering

Indicate right-hand fingering only in educational music and in very exceptional circumstances, e.g. to show a special pattern of fingering. Fingering is indicated by the initials of the following Spanish and Italian words:

p = thumb (Spanish: pulgar, Italian: pollice)
i = index finger (Spanish: indice, Italian: indice)
m = middle finger (Spanish: medio, Italian: dito medio)
a = third finger (Spanish: anular, Italian: anulare)

(The little finger is not normally used for playing, except in the flamenco strumming technique rasgueado — see p. 380.)

Place fingering above or below the respective notes, if possible clear of the stave. Fingering is a technical instruction and therefore, strictly speaking, should appear in roman typeface; however, italic is recommended, as it helps to differentiate the fingering from other technical text.

A horizontal line follows a fingering to indicate the repeated use of the same finger (some editions use a dotted or even a wavy (trill) line in order to have a visually different line for each commonly used technique):

[musical example]

### Chords

Stack fingering in front of a chord where room allows. A vertical bracket may indicate notes to be played with the same right-hand finger, or, more usually, the thumb (the last chord uses separate stems to clarify which notes the bracket includes):

[musical example]

To specify that one finger is to play an arpeggiated or strummed chord, place the indication at the tail end of the arrow (a); when arrows are positioned above the chord, the fingering goes above the arrows (b):

[musical example]

(See also Playing style of chords, p. 378.)

## Left-Hand Fingering

Arabic numerals indicate left-hand fingering: 1, 2, 3 and 4 — the thumb is not used. The open string is a zero and not a small circle. (A small circle is sometimes used for harmonic notation — see Harmonics, p. 384.)

Place fingering right beside the notehead, ideally directly in front of, or above, the note. It may be placed within the stave, if necessary, as long as it is legible. Where there is a combination of both left-hand and right-hand fingering as well as string indications, it is the left-hand fingering that goes closest to the notes:

[musical example]

Where one finger is to continue on the same string but change position, it is helpful to show this by placing a thin line between the finger numerals. The line slopes in the direction of the pitch change; it may cut through a stem if necessary:

[musical example]

(A line connecting two noteheads, rather than two numerals, shows a finger shift in which the second note is not plucked — see Finger shift, p. 377.)

Some editions use only short lines in front of the second numeral. These may be substituted if there is no space for the longer lines or where longer lines might be confused with an audible glissando — although this should have its own specific instruction.

### Fret Position

A roman numeral indicates the fret at which the left hand places the first finger, and is placed above the stave. Fret numerals are added to promote good fingering practice. They are essential for notating natural harmonics.

### Barré

A finger (usually the first, occasionally the third or fourth) holds down all or some of the strings at a specified fret.

Grand barré is the term used for the covering of four, five or all six strings. It is distinguished from the half barré, which covers three or fewer strings, as follows:

grand barré | notated as | C + fret number | e.g. CVII
half barré | notated as | 1/2C + fret number | e.g. 1/2CIV or cIV

The C stands for capo or capotasto. This term, or its Spanish equivalent cejilla, refers to a movable bar used in flamenco music that clamps over the fingerboard to raise the pitch of all the strings.

As a reminder not to change position, a horizontal line (solid or dotted) may extend for the duration of a barré. A vertical bracket may precede a chord to indicate how many strings the first finger stops. The bracket precedes accidentals and left-hand fingering; an arpeggio line is placed before it.

[musical example]

A vertical bracket accompanied by a fingering numeral indicates the use of the same finger across two strings:

[musical example]

## Left-Hand Techniques

### Slurs

In guitar music, the dotted slur is used to indicate left-hand finger work, known as ligado or 'left-hand legato'. Only the first note is plucked; using different fingers, the left hand fingers as many notes as are indicated under the slur. (This achieves speed or legato between the notes.)

It is customary to place the dotted slur next to the noteheads, even where there are two or more parts on a stave, in order to keep left-hand fingering instructions (numerals and slurs) close together. However, where the stave is already dense with notation, it may be easier to read the slurs at stem ends.

Solid slurs indicate musical phrasing. These may also be placed on the notehead side in two-part writing if necessary, since, in guitar music, there is often so much detail to place around the stave:

[musical example]

### Glissandos

#### Finger Shift

This is a special technique in which the right hand plucks only the first note while the left hand slides to a second pitch on the same string, with the same finger, without making an audible glissando. Notate a glissando line between the pitches and add a slur to indicate that the second note is included in the one plucked stroke. For further clarification a guitar editor may add fingering for both notes of the slide in the first instance:

[musical example]

#### Audible Glissando

An expressive glissando must be marked gliss. to distinguish it from the finger shift. If the second note is to be plucked, there should be no slur between the pitches:

[musical example]

#### String Bending

This is used both as an expressive device and to produce microtones. The left hand remains in the same fret position but stretches a string after it is plucked, to produce an audible bending of pitch (a). By bending the string before plucking it (a 'pre-bend') the player can produce a microtone (b). Give a verbal instruction in both cases:

[musical example]

## Right-Hand Techniques

### Playing Style of Chords

Guitarists are able to use a technique that makes chords of 5-6 notes sound un-arpeggiated: the thumb very quickly sweeps across the lowest strings while available fingers take the upper notes.

Chords that are to sound rolled should be preceded by a wavy arpeggio line or, for a sequence of chords, by the verbal instruction arpeggiando.

Chords that are to be played unbroken do not require an instruction non arpegg, although, as guitarists have a tendency to arpeggiate chords, this can be a useful reminder not to do so. The instruction is also useful after a passage of arpeggiated chords, so that simile is not assumed. Vertical brackets should not be used to indicate non arpegg. in guitar music, as this symbol indicates that notes are to be played with the same left-hand or right-hand finger.

Arpeggiation is assumed to be in an upward (pitch) direction unless otherwise indicated by a downward arrow. An upward arrow is used subsequent to a downward arrow to indicate upward direction.

The speed of an arpeggio is indicated verbally: arpegg. lento, arpegg. rapido, etc.:

[musical example]

(See also Arpeggiated Chords, p. 131.)

### Strumming

An arrow indicates that the whole chord should be strummed. For more than the occasional chord, arrows are best placed above the stave:

[musical example]

(To place right-hand fingering for spread chords, see example Fingering for arpeggiated chords.)

In a dense texture (e.g. highly chromatic or with complex rhythms), it is acceptable to abbreviate passages of repeated chords by using stems alone after the initial chord. Such passages may be easier to read if noteheads are reserved for changed chords, especially when chords have six notes:

[musical example]

(See also Repeated Chords, p. 231.)

### Rasgueado

A flamenco technique for strumming with the back of the fingernails, rasgueado (abbrev. rasg) requires a verbal instruction. If necessary, the extent of rasgueado may be indicated by a dotted line or else subsequently cancelled by ord., nat. or norm.

[musical example]

### Two Strings of the Same Pitch

The playing of alternate strings is indicated by a zero for each open string note (not — as is the convention in bowed string music — by separate stems):

[musical example]

When two strings are to be sounded together, notate two noteheads. It is always helpful to specify the open string(s):

[musical example]

### Tremolos

#### Single-Note Tremolo

Specify whether a tremolo is measured (by initially notating rhythms in full) or unmeasured (by using the tremolo sign). The player decides whether to use one finger, different fingers or a plectrum, although the type of fingering may be prescribed for a special effect.

One string is used, unless additional noteheads indicate two, or even three. Place any special fingering above the note. A single-finger tremolo has a more percussive effect and is sometimes indicated quasi mandolino or like a mandolin; alternatively, indicate the required finger:

[musical example]

(For general tremolo notation, see Tremolos, p. 219.)

#### Trills and Two-Note Tremolos

These can be executed in two different ways. One technique is for the right hand to play the initial note and thereafter the left-hand fingers to alternate the notes. This uses the ligado technique. A dotted slur between the two notes or the two fingerings indicates this:

[musical example]

A second technique is a cross-string trill or tremolo: the left hand holds down two notes on adjacent strings whilst the right hand rapidly trills using a prescribed combination of fingers. Indicate both right-hand fingering and the required strings. Note that a slur should not connect the two notes:

[musical example]

(See also Two-note tremolos, p. 225.)

### Area of the String on Which to Play

To place the right hand other than in its normal position (i.e. over the soundhole), give a verbal instruction above the stave:

| verbal instruction | technique |
|--------------------|-----------|
| sul pont. (ponticello) | near the bridge |
| sul tasto | over the frets |
| flautando | play at the octave nodal point |

(Flautando gives a pure, woody sound but is not a harmonic. It may also be indicated clarinet tone, so called as the playing position dampens the note's harmonics to produce a clarinet-like sound.)

The instructions are cancelled by ord., nat. or norm. (terms that are used equally to cancel a non-standard technique). Alternatively, a dotted line extends for the duration of the technique.

### Timbral Techniques

#### With Fingers or Plectrum

The normal method of playing is with the fingers. If the sound (or technique) of a plectrum is desired, then include the instruction with plectrum. It is best not to be too technically prescriptive but to describe the intended timbre instead (e.g. percussive, brilliant or metallico) and to leave the guitarist to choose how to play the passage. To return to normal playing, indicate with fingers or ord., nat. or norm.:

[musical example]

The term polpastrello indicates that the player should use only the fleshy part of the finger (or, more usually, the thumb).

#### Pizzicato

Pizzicato (also called sons étouffés — French, 'muffled sounds') is a technique that deliberately mutes the sound. The instruction is cancelled by ord., nat. or norm., unless a horizontal line extends for its duration:

[musical example]

#### Snap Pizzicato

The snap pizzicato, in which the string rebounds against the fingerboard, uses the Bartok pizzicato symbol borrowed from bowed strings:

[musical example]

#### Tambora

Tambora (Spanish for 'snare drum') or tamburo (in Italian) is the technique of striking the strings next to the bridge with the side of the thumb. Follow the instruction with a dotted line indicating its duration:

[musical example]

#### Golpe

This flamenco technique involves knocking, striking or flicking the body of the guitar with the fingers or thumb. Indicate the rhythms with crossed noteheads just outside the stave and add the instruction golpe (Spanish, 'strike' or 'knock'):

[musical example]

(For placing technical instructions, see Technical instructions, p. 492.)

Give a verbal instruction if the player is required to strike a particular part of the instrument or in a specific way. In Henze's Royal Winter Music, a diagram at the beginning of the piece differentiates three specific areas to be struck (labelled A, B, C). Each area is designated a notehead in a space on a two-line stave. (Similar notation differentiates areas to be struck on other resonant instruments: see examples under Harp: Percussive sounds on body of instrument, p. 369.)

## Sustaining and Damping

When certain notes should specifically be left to vibrate (laissez vibrer), notate the full value of the sustained notes; this serves as a useful reminder to keep these notes held down:

[musical example]

Notating the precise duration of sustained notes counterbalances the guitarist's natural tendency to let the strings ring on: the player must damp the strings to observe the rests.

Where notation of sustained notes is cumbersome, place an open tie after each note. Where there is to be no damping of a figure or in a passage, give a general instruction: i.e. sempre.

(See also Open ties, p. 72.)

An instruction to damp all strings may be indicated by the damping symbol, used in harp notation. Place the symbol above the stave. This symbol should be reserved to countermand an l.v. sempre instruction; otherwise damping will be executed with the rests:

[musical example]

Individual notes or chords that should be damped can take staccato dots or else a verbal instruction such as secco.

## Harmonics

The guitar can produce both natural and artificial harmonics. Both types may be written as diamond noteheads. Minims and semibreves take open noteheads, while shorter values take black noteheads.

The notation of harmonics is not standardized and so it is essential to qualify the notation used. Since guitar music sounds an octave lower than written, notation of harmonics should also relate to the written pitch of guitar music and not to concert pitch. This includes the notation of qualifying sounding pitches.

### Notation Options

There are several different approaches to writing harmonics.

#### Harmonics as Diamond Notes

Many composers write all harmonics as diamond notes at the pitch at which they will sound (i.e. as if they were ordinary fingered pitches) without distinguishing between natural and artificial harmonics. This leaves the player free to work out the best way to play each harmonic.

#### Contrasting Noteheads for Natural and Artificial Harmonics

Another approach is to differentiate the notation of natural and artificial harmonics. Some composers (e.g. Carter in Changes) use an ordinary notehead with a small circle for natural harmonics and a diamond notehead for artificial harmonics, writing all harmonics at the pitch at which they sound:

[musical example]

Other composers have used diamond notes for natural harmonics and ordinary notes with circles for artificial harmonics (e.g. Walton in Five Bagatelles).

#### Diamond Notes at Fingered Pitch

Yet another approach (favoured by, for example, Kagel and Lachenmann) is to place a diamond at the fingered pitch (the fret at which the left hand touches the node of the harmonic). This notation equates to finger-pitch indication for the natural harmonics of bowed strings.

Natural harmonics take black diamond notes for crotchets and shorter values; artificial harmonics use open diamonds for all note-values. The octave artificial harmonic is written with the stopped pitch as an ordinary note below the diamond. (Bowed strings are notated using the same principle.)

Except for the octave harmonic, the fingered pitch produces a completely different resultant pitch. The qualifying sounding pitch must be given in brackets:

[musical example]

(The notation of artificial harmonics other than the octave always uses this form of notation.)

#### Recommended Notation

If the composer knows specifically how to achieve the sound required and wants to prescribe this, it is helpful to differentiate the notation of natural from artificial harmonics.

Diamond notes are recommended for writing harmonics rather than normal notes with small circles above, since the circle can easily be confused with the open string zero. All the following examples use diamond notes for both natural and artificial harmonics.

### Natural Harmonics

To produce a natural harmonic, the hand (usually the left) touches the string at one of the nodes (a specific fret) above the open string (the fundamental) while the right hand plucks the string. The position of the node is indicated by fret numeral. The available harmonics are:

TABLE 1: Available natural harmonics

[musical example]

(Notes higher than the fifth harmonic are available but less secure.)

Write the harmonic at its sounding pitch. The fingered and the sounding (guitar) pitch are the same for the octave harmonic (as they are for bowed strings):

[musical example]

Because fingered and sounding pitches of the other natural harmonics differ, always state the written pitches of natural harmonics: e.g. 'natural harmonics are notated at sounding pitch (for the score reader, an octave above concert pitch, in the manner of the rest of the guitar part)'.

Fret indications are essential, as they show where the left hand must touch the string in order to produce the indicated note:

[musical example]

The exclusive use of the octave harmonic does not require string number indication; all other harmonics do. When different natural harmonics are used, it is helpful to mark string numbers for the octave harmonics as well:

[musical example]

### Artificial Harmonics

#### Octave Harmonics

Any note can be produced an octave higher as an artificial harmonic. The left hand stops the string to create a fundamental; the right hand touches the string an octave higher with the index finger, while plucking with the thumb or another finger.

Some players prefer to have artificial harmonics notated as they would sound for the player, but others find this confusing since the guitarist must transpose the notes down an octave for the correct fret note. The recommended notation is to write a diamond notehead at the stopped pitch (i.e. the fingered pitch for the left hand).

Because of these different practices, it is essential to qualify the written pitches of artificial harmonics: e.g. 'artificial harmonics are written at fingered pitch and sound an octave higher'.

Label the harmonic art. or art. harm. to distinguish it from the natural harmonic. A subsequent natural harmonic may be labelled nat. if required. Some editions add an octave indication after the instruction: art. harm. 8va to indicate that the harmonic sounds an octave higher than written. This is unnecessary, as the octave harmonic is assumed unless otherwise specified.

Notate the stopped note, using ledger lines as necessary (do not use octave signs, as these may be confused with art. harm. 8va labelling):

[musical example]

#### Other Artificial Harmonics

Artificial harmonics can also be produced at other intervals above the fundamental. The right hand may touch the string a minor or major third, perfect fourth or perfect fifth above the stopped note. The resultant intervals are the same as those of a bowed string instrument and should be written in the same way. Use an ordinary notehead for the stopped note, and an open diamond note for the node (the right-hand position). Indicate the sounding pitch in brackets after the fingered pitches:

[musical example]

### Harmonics Combined with Ordinary Notes

Natural harmonics may be combined onto a single stem with ordinary stopped notes (a). For all harmonics, however, it is clearer to use separate stems (this is essential for artificial harmonics) so that a chord is not confused with artificial harmonic fingering (b):

[musical example]

## Scordatura

The re-tuning of one or more strings ('scordatura') is frequently used in guitar music, often to produce specific natural harmonics or to alter the instrument's basic resonance.

Indicate the different tunings above the first stave:

[musical example]

Notate the strings at sounding pitch. Only if there are multiple string retunings is it more helpful for the guitarist to read fingered pitches and the part to be transposed. If such transposition is used, it is essential to specify strings precisely to ensure that the required pitches result.

For scordatura using microtonal tuning, it is unnecessary to include the resultant microtones once the unconventional tuning has been indicated, provided that the scordatura string is always labelled:
