# 17. Score Layout

## What is included in a full score

A full score should record the content of each individual performer's music. All instructions written in the performance material should be included, as should specific articulation: phrasing, tonguing and bowing. Only very specialized technical instructions, such as fingering, may be omitted.

The score should include any ossia parts that may be used in the absence of other players or singers (see Playing cues, p. 498).

## Matching information for all materials

As well as a full score, material for a single work may comprise a rehearsal score (a keyboard reduction of orchestral or ensemble material for rehearsal purposes — see p. 548) and an individual part for each instrument. A work involving chorus should also include a vocal score (vocal lines and keyboard reduction) or chorus part (vocal lines without reduction). All the material must match in common points of reference: movement headings, rehearsal letters or figures and bar numbers (see Bar numbers and Rehearsal marks, p. 484; also, Placing tempo and rehearsal marks, p. 520).

### Running heads

For works in many sections (movements, acts or scenes, songs or other numbers), headings at the top of each page help the musician to identify a particular place quickly. The most helpful references are movement, section, act or scene numbers. These headings are useful in a full score, rehearsal or vocal score and chorus part, and may be added to the running-head instrument labels in instrumental parts (see Labelling the part, p. 558).

## Title page

A score should begin with a title page on the first right-hand page. The title page lists the following:

- the work's composer (and arranger if relevant)
- title
- forces
- year of composition (and/or arrangement)
- author of texts
- score genre (full/playing/vocal/rehearsal score)
- publisher's name (if relevant)

## Front matter (Preface pages)

Provide the following essential information at the front of the score, between the title page and the opening page of music. This front matter is also known as preliminary pages. Include all requirements specific to that score (listed in suggested order of appearance):

- publication information (if relevant): publisher's name, address; place and year of publication (this appears on the left-hand page after the title page — known as the 'title verso' — if there is one, otherwise at the bottom of the title page); see also Optional information (below)
- list of contents (if appropriate), together with page references: pieces in a collection; song or movement titles; scenes in a dramatic work
- details of optional cuts or flexible order of numbers (if relevant)
- preface written by the composer/arranger/author (e.g. for a new edition)
- commission acknowledgement, and funding body (if different) and any other acknowledgements
- first performance details (performers/venue/date)
- duration (even if necessarily approximate)
- instrumentation (see below)
- score transposition (see Notation conventions, p. 504)
- specification of vocal forces, speakers or actors necessary in addition to the title description (see Labelling Choral forces, p. 462); named characters listed with their voice parts
- texts — e.g. poem, narration (see Text, p. 437)
- electronic requirements including any recommended option for amplification (see Equipment, p. 591)
- a diagram of an unconventional seating arrangement that may be required for co-ordination purposes
- notation conventions (see below)
- performance instructions (see p. 491)
- programme note

Add commission, first performance details and duration to the title page if no other pages are devoted to the above front-matter items.

A dedication (or epigraph) may be placed on the title page above the title, or on a separate page (traditionally this would be on the third page).

Optional information: to be printed on the title verso where relevant:

- copyright notice in addition to that placed on the first page of music (see Information on the first page of music, p. 504)
- statement of performance rights (if the composer/publisher is a member of the collecting society within the relevant territory)
- credit for type-setter, designer, etc.
- printer's name
- details of from where to hire materials

### Page numbers

Preliminary pages are numbered separately from the music, using lower-case roman (rather than arabic) numerals to distinguish them from the music's page numbers, with the result that the first page of music begins on page 1 (if a right-hand page) or page 2 (if a left-hand page). Often preliminary pages do not have any page numbers: only pages referenced in the contents list or elsewhere in the score need to be numbered (the title page does not take a numeral). The front-matter pages are counted in sequence from the first page: thus, printed numerals may start with a preface note or any other lengthy piece of text that is referenced subsequently (e.g. as p. vii). Centre these numerals at the bottom of the page.

(For paginating the music, see Pagination, p. 483.)

## Instrumentation

Unless every instrument has been described in the title, list all instruments in the order in which their staves appear in the score. Indicate the following:

- the number of players of each woodwind and brass instrument
- all doubling instruments. In a wind section, specify which players double on which instruments (see Doubling, below)
- specific woodwind and brass instruments, e.g. Trumpet in D (see Labelling transposing instruments, p. 510)
- timpani as a separate item from percussion, stating whether more than one player is required
- the number of percussion players, all instruments, ranges and types of non-standard instruments (see Listing instruments and specifications, p. 272). If extensive, this may appear as a separate list
- a minimum or specific number of players or desks in a string section (optional but helpful)
- instruments with particular technical requirements: e.g. Double bass (with C extension)
- essential attributes required of non-standard instruments
- acceptable alternative instrumentations

Doubling: Place the doubling instruments in brackets. The ":" sign may be used, e.g. 3 flutes (II = alto flute, III = piccolo). Roman numerals clarify that it is the one named player (e.g. player 2) who doubles and not two or three players (see also Doubling instruments in orchestral music, p. 530).

## Notation conventions

Indicate the written pitch of transposing instruments in a score with a statement such as 'transposed score' or 'score in C' (see Score transposition, p. 505).

Explain any special notation, including:

- non-standard symbols
- unconventional accidental systems (see Accidental systems, p. 86)
- symbols used for microtonal accidentals (see Microtones, p. 94)
- special tunings
- playing style, e.g. for modes of attack, or as damping conventions
- particular performance conventions, e.g. for performing ornaments or grace notes
- procedure for independent repetition (see Instructions for repetition, p. 624)

Do not assume that the musicians will be familiar with any (even slightly) unconventional notation. Although they may be conversant with the following symbols, they need to know that their interpretation agrees with the composer's intentions:

[musical example]

## Information on the first page of music

Place the title of the work, the composer, arranger and author of any texts on the first page of music. Centre the title at the top of the page, with dedication (if required) above it, in italic. Beneath, the composer and arranger are placed on the right, flush with the right-hand edge of the staves. Author and translator are credited on the left, aligned with the left-hand edge of the printing area, level with the composer's name. These proper names usually appear in small capitals.

Copyright material must be credited. The credit line should appear in a conspicuous position as close to the front of the score as possible. Under the Universal Copyright Convention the credit must include the symbol © in order to secure international copyright protection. State:

© year of first publication (or date of composition if unpublished), copyright holder

Copyright credits for music should be placed at the bottom of the first page of music (usually aligned with the left-hand edge of the staves).

The wording of credits for texts should be agreed with the author or agent on his or her behalf. These may be placed with the music copyright line or else beneath a copy of the text source if one precedes the music (see Text, p. 437). If a work has more than one copyright owner (e.g. the composer, the author and an independent translator of a text), allot separate copyright credits for each.

## Score transposition

Some thought must be given to the ultimate market of a full score.

### Transposed score

For an experienced conductor, the 'transposed score' in which transposing instruments are written as the player sees them looks correct. The notation of the score and instrumental part match identically. Both conductor and player can discuss pitches knowing that they have the same written notes. The conductor is in a position to spot errors made in transposition, although he or she will have no source against which to check these.

A transposed score places the pitches of transposing instruments comfortably on the stave. Thus it has the great advantage of showing if instruments play in their normal range. For example, all transposed clarinet parts have the following standard written range (at times extending upwards by a major third or even beyond):

[musical example]

(Basset horn, bass and contrabass clarinets can play up to a major third lower.)

For this reason, it is usual to provide a transposed score for all types of wind and brass ensemble music. However, complex wind band scores are sometimes notated in C (for wind band, see Transposition and key signatures, p. 539; for brass band, see Clefs, transposition and key signatures, p. 546).

If players will be performing from a score, transposed instruments must appear in their transposed form (see Playing score, p. 538).

In a chamber-music score or one with piano accompaniment, the line of a transposing instrument is usually notated at transposed pitch, so as to tally with the instrumental part.

### Concert-pitch score

In a 'score in C', where all instruments are written at concert pitch, it is easier to check harmonies and the score is without danger of mistranspositions. However, should there be any transposition mistakes in the parts, the conductor will not be able to spot these.

## Clefs

The clefs in a score should be those used by the player, and that appear in his or her instrumental part: e.g. a Viola line in a score uses the alto clef except when the tessitura is too high; a high bassoon or tenor trombone line should be written in the tenor, not the treble, clef. In a transposed score, a line for any type of clarinet appears only in the treble clef.

A score in C may use treble and bass clefs freely for transposing instruments. The range of the bass clarinet or horn, for instance, will require both clefs to avoid multiple ledger lines (see also Minimum ledger lines, p. 524).

### Octave-transposing clefs

Instruments that sound an octave higher or lower than notated should never be written at actual pitch, whether the score is written in C or transposed (see also Double bass harmonics, p. 423). The conventional octave transpositions are specifically designed to avoid the ledger lines that notation at actual pitch would necessitate.

To indicate an octave transposition, an '8' may be attached to a clef. This notation is optional, but the modified clef makes it easier to identify the position of instruments with such transpositions in a score. (The practice of using these clefs originates from a time when it was felt necessary to clarify octave transpositions: composers such as Schoenberg started a trend by producing scores with all instruments notated at actual pitch, i.e. without any octave transpositions.)

**TABLE 1: Octave-transposing instruments**

| clef sounding two octaves higher | clef sounding one octave higher | clef sounding one octave lower |
| --- | --- | --- |
| piccolo | glockenspiel | contrabass clarinet |
| | crotales | contrabassoon |
| | xylophone | double bass |
| | celesta |  |
| | guitar |  |
| | bass flute |  |
| | bass oboe/heckelphone |  |

It is assumed that a score uses this octave-transposing convention, whether or not the octave-transposing clefs are indicated. Alternatively, instead of the modified clefs, a note may be added to the preface for clarity: 'Throughout the score, piccolo and celesta sound an octave higher than written, and contrabassoon and double bass sound an octave lower than written.'

### Exchanging ordinary and octave-transposing clefs

Place an octave-transposing clef before the relevant entry; replace it with an ordinary clef before the entry of an instrument that sounds at written pitch. When the clef change is mid-system, place the new clef just before the entry. When several rest bars precede the instrument change, place the new clef at the beginning of the first system after the instruction to change instrument (give warning of the new clef at the end of the previous system):

[musical example]

The advantage of not using the octave-transposing clefs is that the clef exchanging is redundant.

(See also Labelling instrument changes, p. 510.)

## Instrument labelling

On the opening page of music, label each stave with the unabbreviated instrument or voice name in the margin. Doubling instruments may be given in brackets here, although it is more usual to list all doublings separately in an instrumentation list.

It is traditional to repeat unabbreviated labels at the start of each movement. The first system of each movement should be indented — this provides margin space for labelling.

In orchestral or large ensemble scores, all subsequent pages take instrument or voice labelling in the margin, abbreviated to save space (see Table 3, p. 511).

A small ensemble score that retains all staves on each system throughout (i.e. one that never changes layout) needs no further margin labelling after the first page; nevertheless, the first system of new movements should still be indented (see Indentation and layout between movements, p. 486).

The typeface allocated to instrument names placed in a score margin should match the one chosen for text instructions within the score. (This style is used for the examples in this chapter that show margin labels, to replicate the appearance of a conventional score (see pp. 509-18 and 531-7). In other chapters and elsewhere in this chapter, instruments appear in the caption typeface, since they function as labels.)

### Percussion staves
A percussion stave should be labelled as such, with each instrument named individually above its entry (see example, p. 516). Individual instrument names appear in the margin only where a percussionist plays a single instrument throughout a score (see Labelling instrument entries, p. 274).

### Numeral styles
A common convention is to use arabic numerals for all individual player labels, but roman numerals for a body of players making up members of the string section. These members may be labelled in the singular or plural (e.g. Violin I or Violins I).

### Margin position

Instrument labels may be centred in the margin space — this is the most traditional layout (see Table 2, column (a), p. 509). Alternatively, they may be justified right (b) or even justified left (c). Player numerals may be arranged left to right after their instrument label (b) or stacked (c). When labels are centred or justified left, it is helpful to move the numerals to the right, up to the margin brackets, so that they are close to their staves (as in column (c)).

### Numerals for shared staves
On an opening page, indicate the number of players (or the numerals for all players) allocated to the shared stave. Traditional practice is to label the number of instruments, e.g. 2 Flutes (Table 2 (a)). Subsequent pages take an abbreviation (see Table 3, p. 511), and have player numerals above individual entries where required. If two (or even three) players share a stave and always play together, there may be no need to allocate numerals in the score at all (see Tacet woodwind and brass parts, p. 529; also, Staves for tacet performers: Opening page of music, p. 521).

It is now common practice to specify player numerals in the margin from the outset (Table 2 (b)). Thus a single player on a given system can be specified in the margin without the addition of a numeral above its stave (column (c), bassoon stave). (A full stop, known technically as a full point, is needed only to separate those numerals appearing on the same line: 1.2.3 and so on.)

## Instrument abbreviation

Exact abbreviations are a matter of individual preference, but avoid ambiguous ones such as cor (which might be cor anglais, horn or cornet). Plurals are unnecessary.

Strictly speaking, there is no need to add a full stop after an abbreviation when its last letter is the same as that of the full word: (e.g. vc. but Vln). However, it is common practice to use full stops after all abbreviations.

In English, it is usual to capitalize all first letters of a margin abbreviation, e.g. C.A. (Names in full can take either upper- or lower-case first letters.)

The longest abbreviation determines the size of the margin: the narrower the margin, the greater the width of the system can be: therefore, keep abbreviations short.

(See Table 3, p. 511.)

## Labelling transposing instruments

Usually a specific transposing instrument is described by key even when it is written in C in the score: e.g. Clarinet in B♭ or Clarinet (B♭) or B♭ Clarinet.

Reserve the description 'in C' for specific C instruments, e.g. Clarinet in C and Trumpet in C. 'In C' should not be used as an instrumental label to indicate that the score is written at concert pitch; always state this separately. For clarity, trumpets written at concert pitch are best labelled merely as Trumpets: if a B♭ trumpet is intended, this should be stated in the instrumentation list.

Abbreviations of instruments defined by key may be split onto two lines to keep the margin width narrow (see Table 2, column (c), p. 509). In a score with many transposing instruments, it is useful to retain the key ('in B♭', etc.) after an abbreviation. In works with few or no transposing instruments this is likely to be unnecessary. The bass clarinet requires a label 'in B♭' after an opening page only if there are instruments in A also in use (see Woodwind: Clefs, p. 253).

## Labelling instrument changes

Indicate an instrument change at the first available rest (see flute example, p. 507). This is the practice in an instrumental part (see Labelling instrument changes, p. 559). Thereafter change the instrument label in the margin of a subsequent system. Advance warning for percussion-instrument changes is usually omitted: this information is less important for the conductor.

## Score order of instruments

### Standard orchestra

Orchestral and large ensemble scores group instrumental sections in the following order (from top to bottom): woodwind, brass, percussion, keyboards, strings.

Instrumental staves remain in the same position in relation to each other throughout a score, regardless of how few staves are present on a system. For example, where the 1st Violin line is the only stave of the string section, its stave is the lowest in the score.

Place horns above the trumpets, at the top of the brass section. Saxophones, either singly or as a group, are placed either between clarinets and bassoons, as part of the woodwind section (this is the commonest practice for a single saxophone) or else as a separate section, with a separate margin bracket and barlines, between bassoons and horns (this is most common for a group of saxophones).

(See also Stave allocation for woodwind and brass, p. 530.)

Place a timpani part above any percussion staves. Arrange percussion staves or lines in player order (see Score order of players, p. 272).

Staves for keyboard, harp and plucked stringed instruments appear below percussion and above the strings. There is no standard order of instruments — any musical association with an instrument on an adjacent stave may influence the order: e.g. harp with strings, piano with percussion. As general guidelines:

- it is usual to place staves for plucked strings (e.g. guitar and mandolin) above keyboard parts
- group together like instruments
- group together acoustic instruments
- group acoustic instruments above electronic keyboards
- place staves for an organ part at the bottom of the section

Example:
```
Harp
Guitar
Celesta
Mandolin
Piano
Harp
Chamber Organ
Piano
Electronic Keyboards
```

Place voices and instrumental soloists above the strings. The stave for a solo singer appears above a chorus, not below it (an instrumental soloist would be placed below chorus lines, i.e. immediately above the Violins).

(See Table 2, p. 509; for the position of an electronic part in a score, see Layout of the electronic component, p. 596.)

### Stave layout for a doubling part
A player doubling two or more instruments (including percussion) should have only one stave (or one pair of staves in the case of a braced part) — further staves suggest two separate players.

(See also Stave allocation for doubling instruments, p. 531.)

When one player alternates between two keyboard instruments (e.g. piano and celesta), both instruments share the same braced part. Label the relevant instrument in the margin; at an instrument change that occurs mid-system, centre a label between the two staves. If a player plays both keyboards simultaneously, label each stave accordingly (see Player with two keyboards, p. 330).

### Individual groups within an ensemble

When an orchestra or ensemble is conceived as separate groups to be seated apart, group the instruments in the score to reflect this. Place the instrumental staves within each group in orchestral order (see extract from Carter's A Symphony of Three Orchestras, p. 517). This applies also to a double string orchestra set-up (see Table 6, p. 535).

When a group of players is conceived as a single unit seated conventionally, preserve conventional stave order — even if there are two or more conductors whom different performers follow at different times. A vertical margin bracket enclosing a conductor or group label may indicate which performers follow which conductor (in the manner that the Carter extract (p. 517) labels the separate groups).

### Off-stage performers

In this section, 'off-stage' refers to players who are separated from the rest of the ensemble, including any player directed to move on-stage in a theatrical work. Staves for players who remain off-stage for a whole movement/scene/piece are placed to the top of the score, above the rest of the ensemble. Their own order of staves follows orchestral order. Enclose the 'off-stage' staves in a thin vertical bracket to the left of the instrument labels, together with an appropriate description such as Off-stage/off-stage/out of sight/distant:

[musical example]

The stave of a player who moves off-stage during the course of a movement remains in its conventional position.

## Small ensembles

In wind and brass ensemble music, the position of the horn stave reflects the instrumental tessitura of the ensemble, high to low — see Table 4, p. 515, layouts for wind quintet (a), wind octet (b), brass quintet (c) and mixed ensemble (g).

In a small mixed ensemble, arrange the staves to reflect the instrumental tessitura, from high to low (g). Arrange instruments of similar range in orchestral order (h). When an ensemble has (at least) pairs of instruments from two instrumental families, arrange the staves in orchestral order — (i) and (j).

### Scores with keyboard
When a score for small ensemble (of about six players or fewer) functions as a playing score for a keyboard player, place the braced part at the bottom of the system — see layouts for piano quartet (e) and mixed ensembles (h) and (k). It is easiest for a keyboard player to identify his or her staves in this position.

In a score for larger ensemble, a keyboard player requires an individual part since page-turning becomes too frequent to be practical and stave size, most likely, too small. In this case, the braced part retains its orchestral position (i).

### Scores with a vocal line

In a small ensemble with voice, the vocal stave appears at the top of the system (j). In a large ensemble, the vocal stave usually retains its conventional orchestral position above the strings.

When a small ensemble score has a keyboard as well as a vocal part, place the vocal line directly above the keyboard, as this is helpful for the keyboard player (k). However, for a trio combination of voice, melody instrument and keyboard, it is usual to have the voice on the top stave, as it is not too far from that of the keyboard.

(See also Stave sizes: Chamber works, p. 523.)

## Score brackets and barlines

### Curly braces

The curly bracket, also called a brace, connects the staves of instruments that use two staves: most commonly keyboard and harp. Extend the brace to three or four staves for piano writing if necessary (see Table 1 (c), p. 331), but not to the pedal stave in organ music (see Organ notation: System layout, p. 342). The brace may connect two or more staves of like instruments (or like voices), but this is a traditional style now rarely used in orchestral music: it is more effective visually — and space-saving — to reserve it for joining the staves of a single instrument:

[musical example]

A brace should only ever be used as the outermost bracket (see example, p. 518).

If, for space-saving purposes, keyboard or harp parts are reduced to one stave, use a compressed brace to the height of the one stave — this makes the braced part easier to recognize (see Minimum number of staves, p. 523).

### Square brackets

The square bracket is beam thickness and has curved ends. In an orchestral score it joins the staves of each instrumental section. When a score is divided into separate ensemble groups or vocal choirs, the square bracket joins the staves of each group individually (see Carter extract, p. 517).

An instrumental section of only one stave takes a square bracket. A score system of only one stave takes a square bracket as well as a systemic barline (see The systemic barline, p. 521).

The bracket is optional for timpani and a single percussion line or stave (see Margin brackets, p. 533). These are the only instrumental staves in an orchestral score without either square or curly margin brackets, apart from soloists (see Table 2, p. 509).

A concerto soloist, concertante group or solo vocal line does not take a margin bracket, since none of these forms part of a larger group.

Groups of solo singers do not need to be bracketed together, and should not be so when a choir is present, as a bracket distinguishes the choir staves (see Layout with soloists, p. 464).

### Secondary brackets

A thin square bracket is recommended as a secondary bracket for joining the following staves:

- two or more like woodwind and brass instruments, e.g. piccolo, flute and alto flute (see Table 2 (a), p. 509); alternatively, two or more of the same instrument (Table 2 (b) and (c))
- two staves and/or additional lines required by a single percussionist for different instruments (see example, p. 516)
- like voices (see Table 1, first column, Divided single choir, p. 463)
- a divided string line

1st and 2nd Violins are regarded as separate sections and are not joined by a secondary bracket.

In a divided string part, a further bracket joins two or more staves of solo players or of the rest of the section (in altri / le altre). The square bracket uses margin space more economically than the brace and allows for further sub-brackets:

[musical example]

(See also Divided string section layout, p. 534.)

### Barring through a score

Barlines join instrumental sections, separating them in exactly the same places as margin brackets. This separation helps to make the position of an instrument on the page clear. Barlines are continuous from the top to the bottom of the system only where the margin brackets are likewise continuous.

When an ensemble comprises more than two separate groups, barlines may join all staves of each group, to clarify the group separation (see Carter extract, p. 517; also, Table 6 (a), Double string orchestra, p. 535).

Each braced part takes separate barlines, as does a concerto soloist.

Each vocal stave takes separate barlines, so that barlines do not intersect the text.

(See also Divided string section layout, p. 534; also, The systemic barline, p. 521.)

### Small ensemble scores

Where there are only a few performers, there are exceptions to the orchestral barring principles.

Margin brackets and barlines join all the staves of a small mixed ensemble: see Table 4, layout (g), p. 515.

Where there are pairs of the same instrument, clarify the pairings with separate margin brackets and barlines: see wind octet layout (b).

In a small ensemble that includes a braced part, square margin brackets are unnecessary for the other parts, as they will have little visual impact: see piano quartet layout (e), also mixed ensembles (h) and (k). Each single-stave part has separate barlines. (Some editions bar these together; others also bracket them together. Joined barlines become visually more helpful where there are four or more single staves, as they clarify the system breaks.)

Where all instruments except one are members of the same family, leave the single instrument without a margin bracket: see layouts (f) and (i).

## Enlarging time-signature symbols

Time signatures placed within each stave as normal are adequate under most conditions.

When a full score that requires a very small stave size has many time-signature changes and many short bar lengths, it is acceptable to enlarge time signatures and to move them out of the staves. This can be an elegant solution to legibility issues, and makes the score less cluttered. Outside the stave they do not need to be much taller than stave height since their unique bold type makes them conspicuous.

Enlarged time signatures are best placed between the staves of instrumental families, where it is useful to have the extra vertical space they require (see Separating instrumental sections visually, p. 520). To place them at the top and bottom of the score requires more vertical space, and potential collision with tempo markings.

Avoid very large or elongated time signatures placed across several staves, as these dwarf all other notation and distort the horizontal spacing on the page. This in turn interrupts the flow of the music, forcing notes on either side of the barline a long way apart. An enlarged time signature is also likely to obstruct ties, slurs and hairpins.

Enlarged time signatures may be positioned slightly to the right of the barline (see Carter extract, p. 517). Alternatively, they may be centred on the barline: this means that the first beat of a bar need not be displaced by the time signature, thus saving horizontal space.

Enlarged time signatures are redundant in an unconducted score.

## Placing tempo and rehearsal marks

In orchestral scores, tempo markings appear above the top stave, and also above the string section, below any vocal or solo lines (see Table 2, p. 509).

Where the ensemble is divided into two or more groups, place tempo markings above each group (see Carter extract, p. 517).

In small ensemble scores, place tempo indications once, above the top stave. Where a keyboard player will be playing from the score, and there is more than one intervening stave between the tempo indication and the keyboard part, restate the tempo indications above the keyboard as well, so that they are sufficiently conspicuous: see Table 4, p. 515, layouts for piano quartet (e) and mixed ensembles (h) and (k). Where a singer is to read from a full score in which the vocal stave is positioned in the middle of the system, place additional tempo markings above the vocal stave: see Table 4, layout (k).

Place rehearsal marks in the same positions as tempo indications (above them where necessary). It is only ever rehearsal marks and first- and second-time ending indications that go above tempi (see Rehearsal marks, p. 484, and First- and second-time endings, p. 236).

## Page layout

### Separating instrumental sections visually

In an orchestral score, it is helpful to add slightly to the space separating instrumental sections. The space between orchestral sections appears, in any case, to be greater than the space between staves within the section, since barlines do not run through this space.

The widest space should be above the strings: this will help to accommodate a high 1st Violin line, as well as the tempo indications and rehearsal marks that go above this section (see Table 2, p. 509).

### Defining systems

#### The systemic barline

The depth of a system is defined solely (in many cases) by the barline that joins the left-hand edge of all staves of a system. Except in a homogeneous ensemble (e.g. a string quartet), this will be the only barline joining the whole system.

The systemic barline should be used to define the system depth at all times, including where a bar is divided over a page or system break (see Splitting bars, p. 489).

#### System dividers
A pair of thick diagonal lines, known as system dividers or separation marks, divides off two or more systems of orchestral (or ensemble) music on a page. Place the dividers midway between the systems, with the strokes protruding halfway into the margin:

[musical example]

Where systems can be well separated, the dividers may be placed on the left-hand side of the page only; where systems are very close together, it is visually helpful to add them on both sides of the page (see also Distance between staves, p. 488).

Dividers are not normally used in chamber scores or choral music: in general all instrumental or vocal staves are retained on each system, so that the layout is regular, and it is assumed that sufficient space has been allowed between systems for dividers to be unnecessary.

### Staves for tacet performers

#### Opening page of music

It is a convention to present staves for all performers on an opening page of score. This accustoms the reader to the layout of the individual piece. It is essential for establishing the order of staves in an unconventional set-up, such as two instrumental groups. Any number of the same instrument may share a stave when resting (i.e. tacet) in order to reduce the number of blank staves — even if these instruments never all share a stave altogether when playing (e.g. four horns). Only where forces are very large is it acceptable to include merely the staves of performers actually playing or singing. This is better than a page full of very small staves comprising mainly resting players — as long as the score provides a complete instrumentation list.

#### After the first page of music

It is standard practice to include only staves of performers who are actually playing or singing on any given system (but see also Filling out a score to create even page depths, below). Omit the staves of tacet performers until their re-entries so as not to clutter the score with blank staves. Where these redundant staves are eliminated, any number of reduced-stave systems may be combined on a page.

#### Small ensemble scores

It is usual to retain all staves throughout a score. Remove a stave only if an instrument or voice is tacet for an extensive period.

If different movements use different forces, state the complete forces in the preface and include only the staves of the musicians required for each movement.

### Filling out a score to create even page depths

Whether a score comprises one or more systems, the ideal layout is to have a similar number of staves on each page.

It is better to fill out short systems with some blank staves (tacet parts), so as to balance the number of staves on a facing page, rather than suddenly to shorten the page depth. Likewise, the distance between systems should not be too large: a page looks unbalanced with too much blank space in the middle.

The tacet staves to include are those of a performer who has just finished, who is about to re-enter or who is tacet for only a few systems. However, do not include copious numbers of blank staves as these are distracting, as are staves that enter and disappear at random.

Sometimes it is useful to retain blank staves so that the position of a performer remains on the same horizontal level across facing (or between neighboring) pages. (This is helpful for the conductor.) For example, where fewer staves are required for only a few bars but the system cannot be reduced sufficiently to fit two systems onto a page, retain a tacet string section, so that the stave levels of other instruments do not change too abruptly from page to page.

(See also Vertical spacing of staves, p. 487.)

## Stave sizes

An orchestral score uses the same stave size for all performers, although cue-sized staves (staves that are three-quarters of the full size) may be used for notating electronic sounds (see Stave size, p. 597).

### Chamber works
When a score doubles as a performance part — usually for a keyboard player — the staves for this performer should be larger than the other staves, so that they stand out from the rest. The stave size for other instruments is about three-quarters of the larger size — these staves are, in practice, cue lines for the performance part (see Table 4, p. 515, layouts (e), (h) and (k)).

If a solo singer must read from the full score (i.e. when no separate vocal score has been created) it may be helpful, similarly, to have the vocal stave larger than the instrumental lines (see Table 4, layouts (j) and (k)).

### Variable stave sizes
Where a score requires a very small stave size (under 4 mm) to accommodate large forces, slightly larger staves may be used for pages with fewer instruments, to help legibility. Avoid too big a contrast between sizes, since even a difference of 1 mm in stave height can look disconcerting between facing pages.

(See also Stave sizes, p. 482.)

## Minimizing vertical space requirements

A lack of vertical space can be a major problem in scores for large forces. The following section provides some space-saving solutions (see also Stave sharing, p. 525).

### Minimum number of staves

Any number of the same woodwind or brass instrument can share a stave, as long as they have identical transposition (see also Stave separation for transposing instruments, p. 531).

Orchestral keyboard and harp parts may be reduced to a single stave in the score. Where both hands play together, notes for the right hand take up-stems, and notes for the left hand take down-stems:

[musical example]

This is purely a space-saving device; the part itself should be notated conventionally, on two staves.

Two percussion players may share a stave, but the timpani part should not share a stave with any separate percussion player (see Stave allocation for percussion, p. 533).

1st and 2nd Violins always have separate staves, even when they are playing in unison, as do cellos and double basses. (Only in old editions do cellos and double basses share a stave.) Any number of string divisions within a section may share a stave (see Divided string section layout, p. 534).

### Minimum ledger lines

Instruments that use more than one clef may be written in a clef that minimizes notes on ledger lines.

A transposing instrument that is written at concert pitch in a score may be notated in both treble and bass clefs to reduce the number of ledger-line notes.

Octave signs may be used freely for any instrument, as long as the score is not used to play from.

(These practices should not be transferred to instrumental parts — see Clefs, p. 562.)

### Sharing performance instructions

Adjacent staves may share technical instructions, dynamics and expression marks. These should be centred between the two staves and accompanied by a small curly brace:

[musical example]

Where an instrumental section or even the whole ensemble has common performance instructions, it is acceptable, in cramped conditions, to place one instruction for the whole group at the top of the section. The instruction must be relevant to every player of the designated group and should be labelled tutti/tutti brass/all violins, and so on. However, where there is room, it is always better to give the information to individual pairs of staves to ensure that the instruction is included when instrumental parts are extracted from a score.

## Stave sharing

The following section refers to two or more players — or a divided string section with only single notes per division — who share a stave.

### Sharing stems

Two or more parts in rhythmic unison share stems, rests, articulation, phrasing and dynamics (single-stemmed phrases should not have two sets of slurs or articulation):

[musical example]

(See also Rests, p. 528.)

Any differences in articulation, phrase length or dynamics between the parts require separate stems (see following example, (a)). The higher player takes up-stems, the lower player down-stems, including when they overlap (b). When only one part is tied, the tied note must take a separate stem (c):

[musical example]

Where a second part joins another in the middle of a phrase, it must take a separate stem, since it requires either its own dynamics or else has an independent attack and thus requires its own phrasing:

[musical example]

(See also following example; also, Dynamics, p. 528.)

#### Interchanging single and double stems

To save space and to keep the score uncluttered, it is acceptable to return to single stems for all unison rhythms that share identical phrase length:

[musical example]

However, where parts occasionally differ in rhythm (as in bars 1 and 4, below), it may be clearer to use two stems for an entire phrase, if room allows, rather than to keep swapping between single and double stems. Change stemming between phrases rather than at the barline (unless the two coincide):

[musical example]

### Unisons

The Italian a 2, a 3, and so on, indicates the number of doubling players in unison. (Note that a is the French spelling.) For strings, a single line is played by the whole section unless otherwise indicated, and is marked unis. after divided playing (not a 2, etc. — see Labelling divisions, p. 428).

So long as the number of players is indicated above the entry, instruments playing in unison may be written as a single line with single stems. It is essential to state the number of wind or brass players for a single-line part at each respective entry (i.e. after division, or when one or more players has been tacet) so that it is always clear how many instruments play:

[musical example]

(See also example for horn section under Placing player numerals, p. 528.)

In a complex score, it is helpful to repeat the doubling indication in brackets: (a 2) and so on, at the beginning of a new system or after a page-turn.

For occasional unison notes or short phrases, use the following notation in order to minimize labelling.

In woodwind and brass writing, a unison for two instruments must show either two noteheads (a) or two stems (b). In string writing, the unison must show two stems (as in (b)) since two noteheads on a single stem indicate that the player should play on two strings simultaneously (see Double-stopping, p. 396):

(a) unison notes as two noteheads (except strings)  
(b) unison notes as two stems (any instrument)
```
two instruments     three instruments     two instruments     three instruments

                                          unis.div.
                                          div. a 3 div. a 2
```

### Three (or more) parts on a stave

As many parts as are in rhythmic unison share stems. A middle part may change stem direction from chord to chord as necessary:

```
three parts          four parts
[musical example]    [musical example]
```

Where there are four parts, players (or divisions) 1 & 2 take up-stems; players 3 & 4 take down-stems ((a) below). However, where outer parts are in rhythmic unison, they can be stemmed together, provided that the player allocation is labelled (b). Label each part at the end of its stem:

```
(a) upper parts in rhythmic unison      (b) outer parts in rhythmic unison
[musical example]                       [musical example]
```

Where part-writing is rhythmically intricate or the lines overlap (as above), it is better to separate them onto a pair of staves. (They can be re-combined onto a single stave when the writing becomes simpler.)

(See also Vertical alignment, p. 490; Horizontal spacing in score format, p. 490, and Accidentals relevant to more than one part on a stave, p. 79.)

### Dynamics

When dynamics differ between parts, place them on separate stems. If the parts have a similar progression (e.g. piano to forte) but at a different rate, they may each have their own hairpin — these can be staggered to avoid collision:

[musical example]

Dynamics for single notes or passages of double-stems need to be placed so that they are both legible and unambiguously attached to the correct notes. If notes are close together and there is a risk of a dynamic being read as applying to both parts, slightly increase the offset between the notes, and place each dynamic next to the notehead to which it belongs. Dynamics may be placed on either side of a note (see Stemming four parts on a stave, p. 490).

## Wind band

Modern practice is to present scores in as close a format to a conventional orchestral score as possible in order to encourage non-specialist conductors into this repertoire.

### Woodwind

As a general rule, clarinets should maintain their symphonic woodwind position, between oboes and bassoons, even though the clarinet section is greatly expanded from that of the symphony orchestra. Saxophones are placed between woodwind and brass (as a group of saxophones would be in a conventional orchestral layout).

### Brass

Traditionally, cornet and trumpet staves appear above the horns, so that the brass section is arranged by pitch, or to give greater prominence to the more soloistic instrument of the brass section — the first cornet or trumpet — whose stave is then at the top of the section. However, the more modern practice is to place horn staves in their orchestral score position, above cornets and trumpets. This has an additional advantage that the often-similar material and sonorities of horn and saxophone appear on adjacent staves.

Place cornet staves above trumpets (cornet sonorities often combine with woodwind and horns). The euphonium or baritone stave appears between trombones and tubas (also called basses).

### Other instruments

The string bass refers to the double bass, and is so called to distinguish it from both tuba and bass guitar (called electric bass in this context). It is placed below the brass, above percussion.

A timpani part appears on a separate stave, above the percussion staves. Instruments of indefinite pitch may appear on single lines to save vertical space in a score; likewise, two percussion players may share a stave, or pair of lines, to save space (see Sample wind band score, p. 542).

Keyboards, harp and non-standard instruments (such as electric bass and accordion) appear below the string bass, above the timpani and percussion.

Place the stave for a solo instrument at the top of the score.

### Margin brackets, barlines and labels

To help to identify an instrument amongst a large number of staves, it is recommended that each instrumental family takes separate margin brackets and barlines. Within the woodwind this makes the position of the much-expanded clarinet section easier to identify. The only exception is flutes and oboes, which may have joined brackets and barlines if preferred.

In the brass section, brackets and barlines may join the staves of cornets and trumpets, and the staves of euphoniums and tubas, as groups with joined staves are easier to identify than many singly barred staves.

#### Margin labelling

To aid immediate identification, it is a convention to label each instrument beside its stave (rather than to share labels between adjacent staves as is often appropriate in an orchestral score). See Sample wind band score, p. 542.

### Stave sharing

Two lines of a divided part or two named parts of the same instrument (1st and 2nd or 2nd and 3rd) may share a stave in the score where convenient. The voicing of parts may dictate which players share a stave (e.g. cornets and trumpets are often voiced so that the 2nd player plays low, and 3rd player plays the middle part, in which case the 3rd player would be more conveniently written on a separate stave). Assign separate staves for parts that carry prominent material: for each of the three B♭ clarinet parts and, if required, for the two alto saxophone parts and 1st cornet part.

### Labelling transposing instruments

It is recommended that, after the first page of music, abbreviations on subsequent pages use as short a form as possible, in order to minimize the width of the margin.

**TABLE 8: Abbreviations for wind band instruments**

Standard labels for page 1 | Abbreviations
---------------------------|-------------
E♭ Clarinet | E♭ Cl.
Clarinets 1/2/3 | Cl. 1/2/3
E♭ Alto Clarinet | Alto Cl.* or A. Clt.
B♭ Bass Clarinet | B. Cl.
E♭/B♭ Contrabass Clarinet | Cb. Cl.
B♭ Soprano Saxophone | Sop. Sax./S. Sax.
E♭ Alto Saxophone | Alto Sax./A. Sax.
B♭ Tenor Saxophone | Tenor Sax./T. Sax.
E♭ Baritone Saxophone | Bar. Sax. (NB: not B. Sax)
B♭ Bass Saxophone | Bass Sax.
Horns in F/E♭ | Hn.
B♭ Cornets | Cnt./Crt.
B♭ Trumpets | Tpt./Trpt.

other abbreviations as for standard orchestra (see Table 3, p. 511)  
* the abbreviation A. Cl. (for alto clarinet) should not be used, to avoid confusion with Clarinets in A  
** B♭ is assumed

### Labelling a multiple-player part

Multiple players play the flute and clarinet parts; extra players may double cornet, trombone, euphonium, baritone and tuba parts and sometimes other lines as well. All players play these multiple-player parts unless otherwise indicated.

#### Solos and tutti

Where there is a divided part on one stave, it is important to differentiate the number of the part (1st/2nd/3rd players) from the number of individual players designated to that line. Some scores define the instrumental part in numerals, and spell the number of players in words: e.g. 1. (one only). However, for the sake of brevity, label each instrumental part with a roman numeral (this applies also to lines that normally have single players), and the player number with an arabic numeral:

Example | Label
--------|------
1st part, 1 solo player then all 1st players | I. 1 solo then I. tutti or I. (one only) then I. (all)
2nd part, two players then all 2nd players | II. (2 soli) then II. tutti or II. (two only) then II. (all)

An instruction for a solo player to play in a soloistic manner may be indicated in rilievo (see Use of 'solo' and 'soli', p. 495).

#### Division and unison
Where a 1st, 2nd or 3rd part divides, this is indicated div and cancelled by unis.

Two parts (e.g. I and II) playing in unison are labelled a 2, three parts together (i.e. I, II and III) as a 3, even though there may be multiple players in each division. It is not necessary to use divisi for a stave that subsequently shows the two separate parts.

Example | Label
--------|------
1st part, divided then unison | I. div. then I. unis.
2nd part alone, then 1st and 2nd players in unison | II. then I+II. a 2

(See also Sample wind band score, p. 542, flute and clarinet staves.)

### Playing cues

In both score and parts, solo material written for more unusual instruments that might not be available to a standard band (such as cor anglais or contrabassoon) should be cued into other parts where possible (see 2nd bass clarinet cue in baritone saxophone part, Sample wind band score, p. 542). Where the number of players specified in the score may be unavailable, cue the material into other parts; e.g. for a passage of three players of the 1st clarinet part, cue the material into the parts of the first players of 2nd and 3rd clarinets (see bar 1 in Sample wind band score, p. 542; see also Playing cues, p. 498).

### Instrumental parts

Each named instrumental part (as listed in the Sample wind band score) has a separate printed copy; i.e. as in normal orchestral practice there should be a 1st flute part and a 2nd flute part and three or more different B♭ clarinet parts. All divisions of each part (e.g. all notes for the 1st clarinet part) appear on the one copy. The notes of two or even three divisions may be placed on one stave, if appropriate, otherwise on two or more separate staves (see Multiple-player parts, p. 582).

### Brass transpositions

It is customary to offer alternative transpositions for the parts of most brass instruments (two alternatives in the case of the lower-pitched instruments). These transposition options cater for players from the brass band world who require the same transpositions for their brass instruments as are found in the brass band repertoire — see Table 7, p. 540.

## Brass band

### Score layout

Brass band standard instrumentation is twenty-five brass players and usually three percussion (twenty-eight players in total). This number reflects the Brass Band Contest rules in the United Kingdom. Player distribution is as follows:

E♭ Soprano Cornet | 1 player | 1st B♭ Baritone | 1 player
Solo B♭ Cornets | 4 players | 2nd B♭ Baritone | 1 player
Repiano (or 1st) B♭ Cornet | 1 player | 1st B♭ Trombone | 1 player
2nd B♭ Cornets | 2 players | 2nd B♭ Trombone | 1 player
3rd B♭ Cornets | 2 players | Bass Trombone | 1 player
Flugel Horn in B♭ | 1 player | B♭ Euphoniums | 2 players
Solo E♭ Horn | 1 player | E♭ Basses | 2 players
1st E♭ Horn | 1 player | B♭ Basses | 2 players
2nd E♭ Horn | 1 player | | 

Many European bands play with larger numbers but without additional parts.

Brass band scores are, traditionally, landscape format. This layout accommodates one system per page but can look vertically cramped for all but the simplest scores. Portrait format is appropriate for a more complex piece, as it affords greater vertical space between staves.

Each named part (as given in the first column of Table 9, p. 547) has an individual stave that should appear throughout the score. It is customary to allocate an instrument label to each stave throughout (and not to share labels between staves as would be the case in an orchestral score). The score order of instruments is standard. Tempo indications appear once, above the top stave.

Where a part taken by two players divides, place both lines on the same stave unless they are too intricate to read easily. When each solo B♭ cornet part has an individual line, allocate two players to each of two staves (the upper two players appear on the upper stave). In the sample score (p. 547), such a complicated layout is acceptable on a single stave only if it is an isolated case.

Generally, the layout for percussion is one timpani player plus two percussion, although sometimes timpani appear within the 1st percussion part (playing other percussion as well) and the other parts are then numbered 2 and 3 respectively. Each player should have a separate stave or line. Timpani and percussion staves are barred together to emphasise their separation from the brass (see Table 9, Sample score layout, p. 547).

### Clefs, transposition and key signatures

Transposed scores are always used in brass band music; conductors are often players themselves.

All instruments, including horns, cornets and trumpets, take key signatures in both the score and instrumental parts.

All brass instruments are written in the treble clef, except the bass trombone, which appears in the bass clef and is the only brass instrument written at sounding pitch.

The clefs and transpositions of all the brass instruments (apart from bass trombone) enable the player to change more readily between instruments: the fingerings and clef are common to all instruments. This is a legacy from the brass band's early industrial past; nowadays, it is less likely that players will swap between instrument.

Tuned percussion: It may be useful to dispense with key signatures for tuned percussion since brass band music is often written in 'flat' keys: thus an instrument in C may require a key signature with many accidentals (see Table 9, Sample score layout, p. 547, glockenspiel part). In addition or alternatively, consider spelling the pitches of a tuned percussion instrument enharmonically, so that the player can avoid a key signature that might be difficult to remember while changing instruments or moving from a percussion clef (see Key signatures in non-tonal or polytonal music, p. 93).

### Player labelling

Player labelling and mute instructions that are normally given in Italian in a conventional orchestral score are often given in English (see below).

#### Solo cornet line

All four players play the solo B♭ cornet line unless otherwise indicated by the following specifications. For other allocations, specify actual players, e.g. 1 & 2 and 2 only (i.e. 2nd player). It is also acceptable to use a 2 and a 3: this allocates the line to the first two or three players unless otherwise indicated (such labelling is compact in cramped conditions). The labels 'Two' and 'Three' (meaning two and three players) are an obsolete style and best avoided. A line is marked tutti or all after a passage for fewer than all four players.

#### Other shared parts

For all other parts that are doubled by two players, an indication of one player is marked 1 only (or 2 only). Two players joining to a unison after either a division or one player playing alone is marked a 2 or both (see Table 9, Sample score layout, p. 547).

### Instrumental parts

Each named instrumental part (as given in the player list on p. 545) has a separate copy. Thus it is usual to have one copy only for the four solo cornet players even though, at times, the part may divide into four lines. If the divided music is too complex to allow for two parts on each of two staves, and thus each player needs an individual stave, then assign a separate copy for players 1 and 2, and for players 3 and 4 (see Multiple-player parts, p. 582).

## Orchestral reduction

An orchestral reduction is the condensing of instrumental lines into a keyboard part. It is often referred to as the piano score or rehearsal score. It functions as a rehearsal tool and may also be a valid performance alternative. All instrument-accompanied vocal music requires a reduction so that soloists and choral singers may learn the music with a rehearsal pianist. (Unaccompanied choral works require a choral reduction: see p. 471.) An orchestral reduction may be required for a work with soloists and orchestra or for a theatre work that is to be choreographed.

Creating an orchestral reduction almost always involves compromise: it is rarely possible to present the complete contents of an orchestral score. The aim is to create a part that is playable by a rehearsal pianist, often at sight. Bear in mind that the pianist may be simultaneously rehearsing a soloist, co-ordinating a group of musicians or following a conductor.

The reduction needs to present the work as fully as possible on two staves, and to contain all significant material (cue staves may be added for extra material). It should not be so densely packed that it is too hard to play or for the performer to pick out a cue. Conversely, an over-simplified rendition will confuse performers when they come to rehearse with an orchestra or ensemble and what they hear bears little resemblance to the reduction.

### Layout

The reduction should be notated as a proper keyboard part. The same points apply for selecting and notating material as for a choral reduction (see Notating the reduction, p. 473).

### Cue staves

One or more cue staves may be added as necessary for extra material. Usually all cue staves appear above the piano part, although bass-range material may go below the part. If the range of the material is between that of the left and right hand, the cue stave may be placed in the middle of the system, although it is usually clearer to place it above the right-hand stave.

A cue stave is only required for the bars that contain cue material, so it may start and finish mid-system. Some editions join each cue bar to the piano part with dotted barlines but this is only really necessary for cue bars that start mid-system, since these would otherwise appear to be detached from the system (for styling, see Practical alternatives to technical difficulties, p. 497; see also example Cueing instruments of indefinite pitch, p. 553).

Cue staves are not included in the margin piano brace.

A cue stave is designed to be read but not played; therefore it may contain as much material as is required. When the piano part becomes complex, transfer some material to a cue stave. Where there is room, cue notes, which are not necessarily playable in addition to the reduction, may be added to the piano staves to save space:

[musical example]

Complex passages may be notated as a two-piano score, with all four staves at full size, so that a rehearsal pianist can alternate the accompaniment. Alternatively, two staves may be braced as a cue-sized piano part and placed above the full-sized one.

#### Off-stage instruments

Music for players seated apart from the orchestra — either on- or off-stage — is separated onto one or more cue staves above the piano part. If there is not room for a separate stave, differentiate the material with cue notes on the piano staves.

### Material to include

When selecting material from a complex texture, include elements of which the performer must be aware:

- aurally dominant material
- an instrument establishing a new tempo or introducing new material
- a rhythm or pitch that is taken up by the performer
- melodic or rhythmic material in counterpoint with the performer
- verbal indication of material in unison with the performer, e.g. violini colla voce ('Violins with the voice')

### Thinning out dense textures

Reduce octave doublings, so that the pianist is not presented with fistfuls of notes. Additional octaves may be indicated verbally, e.g. woodwind col 8va.

In fast chordal passage-work, notate only selected parts (e.g. the top and bottom lines) or the top plus one or two other parts. Note that once a harmony is established, it is most useful to select pitches that are additional to that harmony (bar 2, below).

Simplify dovetailing parts. Moving parts are more important as cues than the duration of sustained parts and it is helpful not to fill the score with too much detail:

[musical example]

Keep dynamics, articulation and phrasing to a minimum, so as not to clutter the reduction. Omit tonguing indications and bowing slurs, and transfer only orchestral articulation that is meaningful to piano playing.

A sustained passage of staggered entries may be notated as a single line to avoid the complicated notation of many held notes. Replace each sustained value with an open tie before the entry of the next instrument. If required, a final chord comprising all the tied pitches may show the release point:

[musical example]

(See also Open ties, p. 72.)

### Wide stretches

Pitches that are likely to be beyond the pianist's reach should be notated as cue-sized notes.

Where occasional chords require stretches that are beyond a pianist's reach, notate the chords either with an arpeggio sign or give lowest notes as grace notes before the rest of the chord. For passages with wide intervals, transpose extremes of a chord up or down the octave; to prevent these altering important intervallic relationships in the chord, transpose other notes in the chord as well, if necessary.

### Indicating instrumentation

It is extremely helpful to indicate instrumentation. When all the material cannot be included in the reduction, the performer must know which instrument the cue is to be taken from. Where singers must find their pitches from the orchestra, it is essential to provide instrumentation details. Indicate labels in a language that will be understood by those using the score (the examples in this section use English except for the Janáček excerpt, which retains its original Italian).

Unless the performer has to take a cue from a particular instrument, a general indication of instrumentation (wind/brass/perc./strings/tutti) is sufficient. Abbreviate individual instrument names. A line played by more than one instrument is labelled in orchestral order: e.g. fl., tpt., vla. (see second example, Cueing instruments of indefinite pitch, p. 553). If it is essential to specify the voicing of a chord, stack instrument labels in correct pitch order (see first example, Notating instruments of indefinite pitch, p. 553).

The addition of an instrument to an existing line is marked with a '+' sign.

Place instrument labels above an entry or, in double-stemmed writing, next to each stem. A label relevant to both staves is placed mid-system.

Entries from alternate groups of instruments may be indicated with separate stem directions. However, this level of orchestral detail is usually not necessary, and it can make the reduction needlessly difficult to read:

[musical example]

### Instruments of indefinite pitch

To represent such sounds in the reduction, notate a cluster at the top or bottom of the piano system, according to the nature of the intended sound:

[musical example]

When the sound is to be indicated but not played, notate cue-size rhythms on a line placed outside the system, or between the staves if space is limited:

[musical example]

### Enharmonic spelling

It is helpful for the pianist reading at sight to see chords and figuration in familiar harmonic patterns. Spell chords according to tonal harmonic principles where possible, regardless of the note spelling of individual instrumental lines in the full score.

In a vocal score, when a line is to be read as a cue, spell its pitches as the most familiar melodic intervals: this helps the singer to hear the cue most easily. Where possible, spell harmonies before or during a vocal entry in such a way that singers can most easily relate their lines to the harmonies. For example, in a highly chromatic idiom, use either predominantly sharp- or predominantly flat-based spelling: an accompaniment in 'sharp' notes is unhelpful with a vocal line based around, say, a key of D♭ (see Note-spelling, p. 85).
