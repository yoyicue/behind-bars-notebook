# 16. Preparing Materials

## Introduction

The importance of good layout to a page of music cannot be overestimated. Appropriate layout choices make music a pleasure to read. Inappropriate layout, such as crowded or over-spaced notation, or a stave size that is too large or too small, bring unnecessary obstacles.

(See also Spacing symbols, p. 41; also, Performance conditions, p. 557.)

## Page sizes and formats

Appropriate page size depends on function and is particularly important for performance material (see Page size, p. 557).

**TABLE 1: Paper sizes**

**INTERNATIONAL PAPER SIZES (EXCEPT USA AND CANADA)**
 
Page size (portrait format, height x width) | Uses
------------------------------------------ | ----
A3 420 x 297mm 16⅝ x 11⅝" | Largest practical size for any performance material
B4 353 x 250mm 13⅞ x 9⅞" | Largest standard size for instrumental parts
A4 297 x 210mm 11⅝ x 8¼" | Smallest acceptable size for instrumental parts <br/> Conventional choral score and piano/vocal score size

**PRINTED MUSIC SIZES**

c. 305 x 229mm c. 12 x 9" | Printed sheet music
254 x 178mm 10 x 7" | Printed choral music
170 x 133mm 6⅔ x 5¼" | Marching band parts

**MARGINS**

Allow at least 15mm/½" for all borders around the printed area of a page — more for a binding edge. A blank margin is essential to allow for the possibility of trim error when printing or photocopying.

### Portrait format

Most music is produced in portrait (i.e. upright) format, which is easier for holding and page-turning than landscape format.

### Landscape format

This 'sideways' format is traditional for organ music (organ music rests do not always have much height) and for educational music produced for small children. It may also be appropriate for piano music in which the pianist is required to play inside the instrument and lay the music flat (portrait format would hamper the pianist from reaching the strings).

Brass band scores may also take landscape format (see Score layout, p. 545).

Page-turning takes longer in landscape format. Such a format is therefore awkward for a conducting or playing score (see Playing score, p. 538). It is totally unsuitable for a copy shared between two players, such as a desk of string players, and for singers who must hold their copies. An exception is the traditional piano duet format where, strictly speaking, the two players are not playing from exactly the same music although they share a copy (see Duet format, p. 329).

## Stave sizes

Before the advent of computer setting, printed music used a number of standard stave sizes. These are known as Rastral sizes or numbers, the Rastral height being the measurement of one stave-space. Each Rastral size is associated with a particular musical format: see Table 2, opposite. (The sizes varied slightly between different manufacturers and there were, also, different numbering systems.)

These sizes are a useful guide to appropriate stave size. Choosing a size that is too small is a real danger; apart from being unnecessarily difficult to read it will not engender confidence in the performer.

A piece of music should have a consistent stave size throughout. Only a full score may use more than one stave size, as a practical solution to widely differing densities of orchestration (see Variable stave sizes, p. 523).

Chamber-music scores may use more than one stave size simultaneously, to improve legibility for a pianist or singer (see Chamber works, p. 523).

**TABLE 2: Rastral sizes**

Rastral number | stave height | application
-------------- | ------------ | -----------
0 | 9.2mm | educational music
1 | 7.9mm | —
2 | 7.4mm | —
3 | 7mm | single-stave parts
4 | 6.5mm | piano music, songs
5 | 6mm | —
6 | 5.5mm | choral music
7 | 4.8mm | cue staves or ossia
8 | 3.7mm | full score

## Pagination

Music starts on a right-hand (recto) page, unless there is a particular reason to start on a left-hand (verso) page — e.g. to facilitate page-turns (see Page-turns, p. 559). Right-hand pages are odd-numbered, left-hand pages even. An opening right-hand page is page 1, an opening left-hand page is page 2.

In publications, the first page of music (i.e. page 1 or 2) is not usually printed with a page number. However, for manufacturing purposes it is useful to be alerted to an opening left-hand page by adding the numeral 2.

Place page numbers clear of the notation, ideally at the top outside edge of the page away from the fold or binding, where they should be aligned with the vertical edge of the printed area. Numerals should be above or at least level with the highest point of the notation: they define the upper boundary of the printed area. Especially in hand-copied manuscript, ensure that page numbers are not too close to the edge of the page or they are liable to be accidentally deleted in the manufacturing process.

## Bar numbers

Bar numbers provide an invaluable reference point in a piece that has separate instrumental parts. They are also a useful guide when preparing the performance material: to check that all material contains the same number of bars, and that rehearsal letters or figures (if used) are placed in the same bars in all parts. The first complete bar (and not an up-beat) is bar 1. The first bar of a piece (or movement) is not labelled.

Bar numbers should not be used in music in which individual performers have different numbers of bars or where barlines do not coincide (see Non-coinciding bar lengths, p. 175). Instead, use rehearsal marks at points where players co-ordinate.

Place bar numbers at the beginning of each system, ideally above the clef of the top stave. To number every five or ten bars gives these bars an apparent significance that they do not have, and should be avoided.

It is best to use italic to differentiate bar numbers from roman-type page numbers, since both are likely to be in close proximity on left-hand pages.

Bar numbers should not be framed in boxes or circles where rehearsal figures are also present, or else the two will be confused.

(For bar numbering with repeat sections, see Bar numbers, p. 237; with Da Capo and Dal Segno layouts, see Bar numbers, p. 240.)

## Rehearsal marks

Place rehearsal letters or figures in conspicuous non-italic bold type, to differentiate them from bar numbers. Many editions use the roman bold time-signature typeface.

Conducted ensemble music should take rehearsal marks as well as, or instead of, bar numbers. Rehearsal letters or figures are better reference points than bar numbers as they can be strategically placed at likely starting points for rehearsal: the beginning of a new section; a change of tempo, character or texture; an important solo entry or passage with fresh technical demands. Well-placed rehearsal marks make most efficient use of rehearsal time, since performers spend less time counting bars.

A work in which all performers and the conductor use the same score, as in choral music, requires only bar numbers and not additional rehearsal marks, since page numbers can be used as a common reference.

Place rehearsal marks at frequent intervals, especially in complex passages. There will then be no necessity to count numerous bars backwards or forwards.

New tempo indications and new movements serve as pointers in rehearsal and therefore do not require rehearsal marks.

Letters have the advantage over figures that they cannot be confused with bar numbers. After Z, AA-ZZ may be used, but additional letters are impractical, and longer scores should use figures instead.

Works comprising short movements should take continuous rehearsal letters or figures for the whole work so that there is no danger that during rehearsal a performer could start, for instance, at the wrong rehearsal letter A. Pieces with longer movements using letters can start each movement afresh, to avoid double or triple letters.

Frame the letters or figures in boxes or circles, so that they stand out from the music. Place them over the system, never under it: a rehearsal letter located between two staves should always refer to the stave below. The letter or figure may be centred over the barline ((a) below), or placed flush-left with the barline ((b) below).

When coinciding with a tempo indication, the rehearsal mark goes first, so as to remain closest to the barline; the tempo aligns after it to save stacking the two (a). If the tempo marking needs to be closer to the first affected beat, e.g. to ensure there is room for a subsequent indication, then place the rehearsal mark above it (b). A rehearsal mark should never go after a tempo marking and be forced over the wrong bar (c):

[musical example]

Where vertical space is limited or where it is more convenient, the rehearsal mark may go below the tempo indication:

[musical example]

(For scores, see also Placing tempo and rehearsal marks, p. 520; see also Matching information for all materials, p. 501.)

## Indentation and layout between movements

The beginning of a piece and each new movement should be indented. This allows instrument names to be given in full in the margin for each movement in full scores (see Instrument labelling, p. 507). Movements are indented even when instrument names do not need to be repeated, for instance, in instrumental parts and small ensemble scores. Movements should begin on a new system and be indented, even when they are continuous (see example opposite).

### DRAMATIC WORKS
When a dramatic work is divided into separate acts or parts, indent these. Scenes are not usually indented, especially if they are continuous, although a new scene should start on a new system to make its position conspicuous.

### Layout between movements

When the music between movements is not continuous, the end of a movement takes a final double barline. Where music between two movements is continuous, the end of the first movement takes a thin double barline and any change of clef, key and time signature is given in advance of the new movement (this advance warning is not provided for non-continuous movements).

A new movement always takes a time signature, even when this is unchanged from a previous movement (see example opposite).

The marking attacca indicates that the next movement follows on immediately, without a pause. This marking can be applied to both a new movement that runs continuously (but where this may not be apparent to all performers) and, also, at a final double barline when there would otherwise be a definite musical break between movements.

Place attacca at the end of the first movement, below the stave or system if room, otherwise above.

[musical example]

## Casting off

Casting off is the term used to describe organizing the layout for a piece of music: the number of bars per system, staves per page, and pages per work.

The skill of casting off is to balance both practical considerations (e.g. amount and size of music to place on a page) and musical considerations with good spacing (see Rhythmic spacing, p. 39; Spacing symbols, p. 41; and Page-turns, p. 559; for full-score layout, see also Page layout, p. 520).

### MUSICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Where possible, changes of section should coincide with a new system, so as to be most conspicuous, as should the start of a repeat section or coda (see Placing repeat barlines, p. 233, and Positioning repeat sections, p. 240).

### Vertical spacing of staves

The ideal layout is a similar number of staves on each page. The purpose of this is to achieve an even spread of symbols between pages, which facilitates fluent reading.

#### STAVE LEVELS BETWEEN FACING PAGES

Match the levels of top and bottom staves across facing pages, regardless of whether the pages have the same number of staves. This is particularly important in a full score (see Filling out a score to create even page depths, p. 522).

Ideally pages should have consistent top and bottom stave levels throughout a piece.

Lower the height of the top stave to allow space for headings on a title page and on opening pages of new movements (even when movements are continuous). A good balance is to have the top of a heading level with the top stave-line of the other pages.

When a page has fewer staves than its facing page, space the staves and systems further apart so that outer staves of the pages are level. When a page contains very few staves, it is harder to read widely spaced staves. Instead, preserve normal spacing between them, either keeping the top stave level with its facing page and raising the page depth (this is the more traditional approach), or, if this has an unwanted 'end of chapter' appearance, centring the page with the shorter depth.

When a pair of facing pages has a shorter depth than surrounding pages, lower the top stave height slightly so that the image does not appear to sit too high on the pages.

When a page requires text or notation symbols that extend some distance above the top stave or below the bottom stave, match the outer margins of the printed image across facing pages by lowering the top stave or raising the bottom stave slightly. This preserves a good-sized margin (see Margins, p. 481): no notation is forced to the extreme top or bottom of the page. Keyboard music often needs this adjustment (to allow for ledger lines, octave signs and pedalling) and also theatre works (to accommodate scene-change instructions at the top of the page).

#### DISTANCE BETWEEN STAVES

Staves should be at least a stave height apart or they will look very cramped. Equidistant staves are not always the best layout: staves placed at variable distances apart will avoid disproportionally wide or cramped spacing between them.

When a page contains more than one system, the distance between systems should, if possible, be greater than the distance between the most widely spaced staves on an adjacent system.

(See also Defining systems, p. 521; for spacing in instrumental parts, see Spacing staves, p. 558.)

#### SPACING A BRACED PART

Adjust the distance between staves from system to system, according to the demands of the notation. Staves too close together or too widely spaced make the music more difficult to read:

[musical example]

### Offsetting barlines

Barlines on adjacent systems should not align. If barlines do coincide, systems containing like material look too similar and the eye is liable to skip a system; in a score, adjacent staves will look as if they are part of the same system. Barlines that do not coincide clarify the system breaks:

Violin 1 part

[musical example]

### Splitting bars

In exceptional circumstances it is acceptable to divide a long bar between two systems so that spacing can be consistent. It is more difficult to read a system containing a single bar if it is over-spaced.

It is only acceptable to split up a bar when a whole bar is too long to fit onto a single system, or when three bars more conveniently fit onto two systems, each system taking a bar and a half (see following example).

In a full score, the incomplete bar should lie across facing pages and not over a page-turn. In an instrumental part, a bar should never be divided between two pages.

Divide the bar between whole beats, and leave the end of the incomplete bar without a barline. To alert the reader to the unfinished bar in an instrumental part, add two short diagonal lines mid-stave.

Place the bar number on the new system in parenthesis to show that this is not the beginning of the bar:

[musical example]

### Horizontal spacing in score format

In a score it is often not possible to have even spacing in every part unless all parts have identical note-values (see Rhythmic spacing, p. 39). The wider spacing required for a variety of subdivided beats will inevitably distort the even spacing of other parts with fewer notes.

Assign even spacing as a priority to the densest part for each beat individually — the most complex rhythms must be the quickest to read. (This issue is also discussed in Tuplets: Rhythmic alignment, p. 200.) Vertically align the notes and rests of other parts in relation to the densest parts. At this point it may be possible to adjust the densest notation to avoid the greatest distortions elsewhere.

Distortion in horizontal spacing is particularly acute when some parts have independent time signatures or non-coinciding barlines, since additional symbols (such as time signatures, barlines and repeat signs) may leave unwanted gaps in other lines (see examples under Score layout with independent repetition, pp. 626-7). Where possible, it is worth adjusting rhythmic spacing to correct the greatest distortions.

## Vertical alignment

The vertical alignment of different parts either on a single stave or in score format should reflect the order in which notes are to sound. Therefore simultaneous sounds should align vertically wherever possible. Notes on the 'correct' side of each stem are aligned, and displaced adjacent notes fall outside the alignment (a); semibreves are treated as if they were stemmed (b). Chords containing adjacent notes should not necessarily align their pairs of notes, since to move a stem to achieve this destroys its alignment with a part on another stave (c):

[musical example]

This alignment of chords between different staves is treated in exactly the same way as when two parts are present on one stave (see Adjacent-note chords: Double stems, p. 49; also, Janáček extract, p. 550; Offsetting unison and adjacent noteheads and Overlapping parts, p. 53).

## Performance instructions

The following general instructions should be placed at the front of a score or instrumental part so that they can be read in advance of rehearsal:

• instructions that require extensive explanation

• advance warning of special requirements (extra instruments, unusual mutes, instrument preparation (e.g. prepared piano), unusual manoeuvres (e.g. moving off-stage): this information should not be hidden away in a footnote in the middle of a part

• general information on interpretation: this is preferable to copious or repeated instructions, which might otherwise clutter the music

A short, specific local instruction (e.g. basic technical description) should appear above the appropriate stave. More complex explanation should take a footnote. In performance material, the instruction must appear on the same page as the technique: a performer should not be forced to turn back during rehearsal to find it.

Use asterisks or other signs (*,**, †, ‡, etc.) for footnotes, and not numerals, which might be confused with fingering, bar numbers, and so on.

### LANGUAGE

Tempi should appear either in Italian or in the composer's native (or a common) language, rather than in a mixture of both. Expression marks and technical instructions may use either. Detailed technical instructions need clear, unambiguous wording, and therefore may be best given in the language of the composer. They must also be intelligible to the intended performers: elaborate instructions in Italian may well be ignored by a non-Italian speaker.

### Text typefaces in the music

Roman and italic typefaces differentiate directives: roman type is used for player allocation, instrument changes and technical instructions, with bold roman for tempi; italic type is used for expression marks, with stylised bold italic for dynamics. The reader is accustomed to this text differentiation, and information can thus be assimilated more quickly.

Some common instructions related to playing styles are almost always given in italic: *staccato*, *legato*, *glissando*, *bisbigliando*, *sons étouffés*. This typeface is inherited from nineteenth- and twentieth-century precedents in which italic was generally used for all Italian markings (or another language foreign to the composer's — or edition's — place of origin). Alternatively, these instructions may appear in roman type (as, for instance, vibrato and arpeggiation instructions usually do). The most important consideration is to use whichever typeface is most legible in the context: i.e. the one that most clearly distinguishes the instructions from other information. Once instructions become very technical, they usually take roman type.

### Technical instructions

Player allocation, instrument changes and technical instructions are placed above the stave and use lower-case letters. They should be sufficiently large to be conspicuous, but not use bold type — which is reserved for tempi and dynamics.

Place instructions as close as possible to the notes to which they refer, rather than over previous rests, so that they are not accidentally overlooked:

[musical example]

(See also Labelling instrument changes, p. 559; also, Mute instructions, p. 563.)

In order for combined instructions to be seen to apply to the first affected note, and not appear to start with later notes (c), they must either be stacked above the first note (a) or start over a previous rest (b):

[musical example]

An instruction required for a specific duration takes a dotted line (not a solid line) and end bracket:

sul G ________ _|

An extended passage can take a sign that is standard for finishing a technical instruction (the sign ⓢ, the coda sign ⑧ or pedal-release sign ⊥) instead:

molto legato al segno ⓢ
or
molto legato as far as the sign ⓢ

Transition between one technique and another takes a solid line with an arrowhead:

senza vib.→poco vib.

After a rest period, it is useful confirmation to repeat instructions in brackets, especially when neighbouring performers have different technical instructions, e.g. some players muted, others without mutes (see following example).

Where there are two parts on one stave, and both require instructions, those for the lower part go below the stave. A divisi indication remains above the stave (see example below) Dynamics for both parts appear between the stave and the instructions. The following example is acceptable only in a score (the divided part should have two staves in an instrumental part):

[musical example]

Simile (abbrev. sim.) is used to indicate repeated technical instructions or expression marks. It is usual to write it in italic even when referring to technical instructions. Do not use Sim. at the beginning of a system, since the performer will need to look back and may lose the place.

[musical example]

Do not replace passages of repeated dynamics or phrase marks with sim., since these instructions are easily overlooked.

### Symbols to replace repeated instructions

Typically, a symbol would replace instructions for a technique exploring a new way of producing a sound. A symbol such as a cross or other sign through a stem, an unusual note shape or a symbol placed above the stave may replace copious repeated verbal instructions. (Any symbol requires verbal qualification in a preface or at its first appearance.) For example, a 'plucking with fingernail' or plectrum symbol saves repeated instructions (see examples under Plucking techniques, p. 367).

Where a technique occurs only occasionally, a short verbal description is more helpful than an invented symbol unique to a piece — this avoids the danger of a musician forgetting its meaning. For various options, see Symbols to express special techniques, p. 298.

A symbol should have a single function in a work or its meaning will be ambiguous. Do not give an existing symbol a new meaning: this is confusing.

Any graphic element should be kept simple, so as to be read quickly. Graphic shapes to be read left to right on the horizontal time-axis, and placed in or above the stave, may show changing sound quality. For example, wedges may indicate different degrees of pressure on particular instruments (e.g. bow or lip pressure). In Harvey's Advaya, normal to excessive bow pressure creates more noise than pitch at the point of strongest pressure (see p. 406). Wedges placed after pitches may illustrate widening of pitch density (by glissandos) into clusters (see example under Rhythm and pitch cues, last bar, p. 593).

A trill line is useful to indicate the presence and duration of a sound, technique or manoeuvre where more detailed information is unnecessary (see example from Harvey's Smoo, p. 299; also, the example Different timbres/textures, (c), p. 597);

### Cancelling instructions

Non-standard techniques may be cancelled by any of the directives as follows:

ord. (modo ordinario)

nat. (posizione naturale)

norm. (posizione normale)

These are always placed at a subsequent entry (see example for cellos, last bar, p. 493), never at the end of a previous one where they are liable to be overlooked.

### Expression marks

Where room allows, place expression marks below the stave, after dynamics (a). When a hairpin immediately follows a dynamic, align the hairpin with the dynamic, and place the expression mark below (b). Where space below the stave is limited, move expression marks above the stave, after any technical instructions (c):

[musical example]

A braced part (keyboard and harp) places expression marks that apply to both hands between the staves, after dynamics.

(For score layout, see also Sharing performance instructions, p. 525.)

## Use of 'solo' and 'soli'

These terms must be used with care to avoid confusion.

The terms solo (for one player), and soli (for two or more players) are instructions to play in a soloistic manner.

For woodwind, brass and percussion, a single player alone is labelled by player number.

In a string section an individual player must be labelled by numeral and solo to avoid confusion with desk or division number: 1 solo, etc, as in example (c) above (see Player allocation, p. 429).

For string players a prominent line should be labelled in rilievo (Italian, 'in relief'). This also applies to designating a solo player in a multiple-player section, e.g. in a wind band piece (see Wind band: Solos and tutti, p. 544).

### Principal voices

To designate individual notes or phrases as the principal line, Schoenberg's Hauptstimme (principal voice) sign H→ may be placed directly above the notes to enclose the prominent material. A secondary voice, Nebenstimme, is notated as N→. These signs are so commonly used that they require no further explanation:

[musical example]

Alternatively, square brackets alone |-| may enclose such material, as long as their function is explained in a preface (see extracts from Carter's A Symphony of Three Orchestras, p. 517, and from Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire, p. 338).

## Optional cuts

Encountered usually in stage works, the relevant passage is marked at the top of the system with the divided word vi- -de (Latin, 'look!') and an explanatory footnote:

[musical example]

This is sometimes accompanied by a coda sign at the beginning or at both ends of the cut (the second coda sign is optional; as in a coda, this sign indicates a point from which to skip ahead).

## The ossia

### Practical alternatives to technical difficulties

An ossia note is given as a small note in brackets and placed on the same stem as the preferred pitch. Consecutive ossia notes need only one set of brackets:

[musical example]

More complex arrangements require the addition of a cue-sized stave for the duration of the alternative material — not necessarily whole bars (see Cue stave: layout, p. 575). The cue stave is usually placed above the main stave, but may be fitted in below if more convenient. Label the cue stave ossia and connect each bar to the main stave with dotted barlines. A solid barline connects both staves at the beginning of a system.

When the ossia stave starts mid-system at a barline, most editions do not include an initial barline through the cue stave: the dotted barline occupies only the space between the two staves (see example below, bar 5).

For an ossia stave starting mid-bar, there is no connecting barline; an ossia stave that occurs only in the middle of a bar is free-floating and not attached to the player's stave.

Some editions do not include a clef for an ossia stave. This is acceptable provided that it is obvious which clef should be used.

Allocate the dynamics, articulation, expression marks and technical instructions of the main stave to the ossia stave, so that the performer has all information on both lines:

[musical example]

This layout is the same as that used in string notation to indicate sounding pitches (see Harmonics: Indicating sounding pitches, p. 421; also, Scordatura, p. 424).

### Playing cues

Material may be cued into another instrumental part or group of instrumental parts for a variety of reasons:

• to provide a substitute for an unusual instrument or a voice that may be missing from the line-up (see example below)

• to reduce the number of performers required

• to reinforce an instrumental or vocal line at the conductor's discretion

• in the event of an absent player in rehearsal (this is useful for material intended for amateurs or for educational purposes)

In the full score as well as the relevant part, notate the material for the alternative instrument as a cue (i.e. in small notes). Choose one of the available cue styles (cue-stems with ordinary directions or stems reversed away from the staves with whole-bar rests — see Stem direction, p. 570) according to whichever is clearest for the conductor and player to read. The cue requires complete performance instructions — technical instructions, dynamics, phrasing, and expression marks — and the correct transposition for the playing instrument. Label the cue 'Play the cue in the absence of ...' or 'Play at the conductor's discretion'.

In The Planets, Holst cues all material for alto flute (misnamed bass flute) and bass oboe that is not already doubled in other woodwind parts.

When the alternative instrument would otherwise be playing if not required to add the cue, notate both lines on one stave and allocate separate stem directions for each part:

[musical example]

(See also Cue notation, p. 569; for wind band, see Playing cues, p. 544; for composition alternatives, see Alternatives (Choices), p. 643.)
