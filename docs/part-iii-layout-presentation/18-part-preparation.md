# 18. Part Preparation

## Preparation

Players will tend to be well disposed towards a work whose instrumental parts are carefully prepared. The size and spacing of the notation, the placing of staves on the page and the timing of page-turns all contribute to the success or failure of a performance. However brilliant a piece is, arguably performers can do justice to it only if it is easily legible, leaving them free to concentrate on delivering the performance.

### Performance conditions

It is very important to choose a stave size that the player is able to read comfortably. Consider the likely performance conditions before deciding on appropriate page and stave sizes.

- If the performer is likely to be some distance from the stand or if two players share a copy, the stave size should be larger than otherwise (e.g. 7 mm)
- In bad lighting conditions, e.g. in an orchestra pit, small notation is difficult to read
- In cramped conditions, avoid large pages for performers who must sit close together (e.g. woodwind players)
- Do not give an enormous (A3 or larger) or flimsy copy to a performer who will need to transfer it from one stand to another (e.g. a percussionist, or a pianist doubling celesta)

An ideal stave size in good lighting conditions is 6.7 mm (see Stave sizes, p. 482).

### Page size

Instrumental parts benefit from a slightly larger page size than A4 (see Page sizes and formats, p. 481).

In order to use an ample stave size to satisfy criteria of legibility, especially at a distance, it may be preferable to have a generous page size. However, if considering a page larger than B4, take into account the following:

- A large copy must fit onto a performer's stand
- The copy should not obliterate the performer's view of everyone else
- The copy must be easily legible from one edge of the double page to the other. For instance, a pianist whose instrument has a high music rest may struggle to read the top of an A3 portrait-format page. Two string players at a desk will have difficulty reading the furthest side of an A3-sized copy

### Spacing staves

Allow plenty of space between systems on a page whenever possible, so that it is immediately clear which notation belongs to which stave. It is essential that there is adequate space to allow players to write cues, beats, fingerings, bowings, etc., above each stave of their copies. The following cramped spacing creates unnecessary difficulties and ambiguities, and would be impossible to use:

[musical example]

(See also Distance between staves, and Spacing a braced part, p. 488.)

### Titles

List movements in all material even if some performers may not be included in one or more movements, so that the musician knows none of the part is missing (see Tacet, p. 580; also, Matching information for all materials, p. 501).

An instrumental part need not have a title page as long as all essential information can be fitted on the first music page (see also Title page, p. 501). Each part should contain a copyright line (see Information on the first page of music, p. 504).

## Labelling the part

On the first page of music, place the instrument name above or below the title, flush with the left-hand edge of the printed area (see oboe example, below). List all doubling instruments and any others the player needs. A part that requires more than one player should state this: e.g. 'Piano (2 players)'.

A percussion part must list all instruments needed, together with the number of players required to play them (see Listing instruments and specifications, p. 272).

For subsequent pages it is good policy to label the top centre of each page with instrument name and player number, in case pages become separated later (this is known as a 'running head'). For a part with instrumental doubling, it is necessary to give only the principal instrument for the running head (see also Running heads, p. 501).

### Labelling instrument changes

A part that has instrumental doubling should label the instrument that plays the first entry.

Instrument changes are indicated 'take . . .' or 'Change to . . .' or simply 'to . . .' (Italian: muta in . . .). When a player (such as a percussionist or a pianist doubling on celesta) needs to move to a new instrument, 'to . . .' is a more appropriate instruction.

To allow a player the greatest possible time to change instruments, place the instruction as far in advance of the entry as possible, i.e. at the first available rest. Where the space on the page between the instruction and the actual entry is significant (i.e. there are many rest bars), confirm the instrument above its entry.

A change of instrument must stand out clearly from other text. Use underlining, capitals or boxed instructions (this is especially important in a hand-copied part):

[musical example]

(For percussion, see Labelling instrument and stick changes, p. 275.)

## Page-turns

The timing of page-turns is one of the most important aspects of organizing an instrumental part. Plan page-turns around the longest available rests. To facilitate this, it is acceptable for a large proportion or even a whole page to remain blank, if necessary (see Stave levels between facing pages, p. 487).

Any long sections without rests must be arranged across a double-page spread, and the remainder of the part organized around this.

A part may start either on a right-hand or a left-hand page, according to whichever arrangement will subsequently result in the fewest or most leisurely page-turns (see Pagination, p. 483).

### Feasible page-turns

Calculate the time available for turning a page by converting the duration of the available rests into seconds. A player who needs four seconds to turn a page requires the following number of beats at the given metronome markings:

Number of beats needed for 4-second page-turn:
- 4 ♩ of ♩ = 60
- 6 ♩ of ♩ = 90
- 8 ♩ of ♩ = 120
- 12 ♩ of ♩ = 180

Beware of rests in a fast tempo that look more impressive in length than they actually are:

[musical example]

The above is only three seconds — just enough time for some wind players to turn, but a double bass player would need at least five seconds.

### Fast page-turns

V.S. (Italian: volti subito, 'turn quickly') warns the player of a necessary fast turn. Place this instruction at the end of the right-hand page. If the turn must take place during a rest in the middle of the last bar, complete the notation of the bar before the turn, adding V.S. over the rest:

[musical example]

(Sometimes it is helpful to repeat the bar — or the section of the bar to be played after the turn — on the following page. Clarify that the bar is stated twice by adding a verbal instruction 'repetition of bar . . .' after the turn; additionally, square brackets enclosing the restated material are a helpful visual reminder.)

Use V.S. only when it is essential to turn quickly, since to use it for every turn lessens its impact.

### Page-turns at rest bars

When there is a single bar of rest (or one multiple-rest bar), indicate this before the turn, so that the player can see the time available to turn. When there are several bars of written-out rests for different time signatures, or multiple-rest bars divided for rehearsal marks, it is more helpful to arrange the majority of rests after the page-turn: players will turn as soon as they have finished playing, to prepare for the next entry.

(For Multiple rests, see p. 564.)

### Where to avoid page-turns

Avoid a page-turn during a short rest if a longer rest is available in which to turn. A very fast page-turn can draw unwanted attention to itself.

A page-turn is impractical during a short rest that coincides with a change of instrument, a muting instruction, pedal changes in a harp part, a dramatic silence (e.g. a G.P. bar), or a very quiet passage (fast pages-turns cannot avoid being noisy).

During a short repeat a page-turn is feasible only if there are sufficient rests at the beginning or end of the section to allow for the turn-back.

Avoid a page-turn for many players at once during a quiet passage. A whole string section turning simultaneously will create massive disruption.

In a string section, even though players sit two-to-a-desk and play from one copy, the inside player should not be expected to turn when there are notes to be played, unless absolutely necessary (see below). If this is unavoidable, it is best if all the strings do not turn in the same place so that there is not a sudden thinning of sound while half the string body turns together.

Even without a turn, avoid a break onto a right-hand page during a short but complex solo that could otherwise fit onto a single system.

In keyboard music, where possible avoid a page-turn in the middle of a complex passage. If the music requires a page-turner, it can be hard for him or her to judge where to turn: an awkward turn may compromise the quality of the passage that follows.

### Passages with no available page-turns

In a string section the inside player turns so that the outside player can continue playing.

A player may be able to play certain pitches while turning with one hand (e.g. for open strings, and for some woodwind and brass fingerings).

In exceptional circumstances one player can turn for a neighbouring player. Place this instruction in both players' copies. If the manoeuvre involves one player needing to stand up, bear in mind that this is distracting for an audience if it occurs other than in the percussion section.

So as to fit all continuous music onto a double-page spread, consider either slightly reducing the stave size either for a single double-page spread or for the entire part, or enlarging the part if appropriate (see Page sizes and formats, p. 481).

### Fold-out (flap)

Where there is extended continuous playing, an extra page may become a fold-out to form a three-page spread. This is feasible only when the player(s) can read the distance across three pages; it is therefore not recommended with A3-sized pages, nor for two players sharing a stand. Furthermore, a three-page spread should be used only where there is room on the stage or in the pit for the extra width of the copy.

A fold-out is most convenient as a first or last page, since it can be folded out in advance. A fold-out in the middle of a copy requires extra time to arrange.

Page-number the fold-out as an adjunct to the page to which it is joined (e.g. '4a' for a left-hand fold-out or '5a' for a right-hand fold-out). Use a left-hand fold-out at the beginning of the copy (which will be labelled page 2a), a right-hand one for a final page.

A four-page spread is a possibility in chamber or solo pieces, where there will be room on stage for two or more music stands per player. A fold-out page is attached to both the left-hand and the right-hand page.

## Clefs, octave signs and time signatures

### Clefs

A clef that has been chosen in a score for the convenience of saving vertical space may not be the most appropriate choice for an instrumental part.

A score may use frequent clef changes to avoid ledger lines. An instrumental part is better written with occasional ledger lines, rather than with frequent clef changes:

[musical example]

When two lines on one stave in a score are to be separated onto individual parts, it may be more suitable to place the lower line in a lower-pitched clef:

[musical example]

Where a score in C has made free use of treble and bass clefs for transposing instruments (e.g. for clarinets), the transposed part should retain the treble clef throughout (this applies to all transposing instruments except horn).

Octave-transposing clefs (8va G, 8ba F) are usually redundant in instrumental parts since this conventional transposition is assumed. A statement at the front of the part can confirm this if necessary (but see also Tuned percussion: Octave transpositions, p. 276). The alternation of octave-transposing and ordinary clefs tends to clutter a doubling part and is best reserved for a full score (see Octave-transposing clefs, p. 506).

### Octave signs

Avoid octave signs for orchestral instruments, except to write notes of five or more ledger lines (see Using ledger lines or octave signs, p. 32, and Woodwind: Octave transpositions to replace ledger lines, p. 255).

### Time signatures

In an instrumental part or playing score, the best position for a time signature is on the stave, so that a performer following his or her line has an individual time signature. Time signatures placed above or below the stave are unhelpful, as the player's eye must leave the stave to take in the time change.

(See also Time signatures: Size and placing, p. 152.)

## Mute instructions

Mutes are usually indicated in Italian. Specific trumpet and trombone mutes tend to have English names, and so all mute instructions for brass may be in either language.

An instruction to mute (con sord.) or to play without mute (senza sord.) appears above the first relevant note (see Technical instructions, p. 492). Where many rest bars precede a mute instruction, it is a helpful convention, particularly in brass parts, to add con sord. or with mute and via sord. or remove mute at the first available rest. This advance warning helps to prevent such manoeuvres from being overlooked. The convention may also be transferred to string parts.

[musical example]

Confirm the continued use of a mute after a period of rests and at the beginning of a subsequent movement. Bracket an instruction that is used for purely confirmation purposes, to show that it is not a new instruction:

[musical example]

(For brass, see also Mutes, p. 263; for strings, see Mutes, p. 426.)

## Multiple rests

A succession of single-bar rests, as appears in a score, is amalgamated into multiple-rest bars in an instrumental part.

The numeral indicating the number of bars' rest should appear in bold type; traditionally a time-signature numeral is used. Usually a multiple-rest bar comprises an extended beam centred on the middle stave-line, with a vertical notch to the adjacent stave-lines at each end. This style of multiple-rest bar may be used for any number of bars: it is simplest to read and it is also best suited to parts on single stave-lines (e.g. percussion).

It is also acceptable to use the traditional style of rests. The width of the rest symbol is half the width of the semibreve rest. Use a centred beam for more than nine bars' rest:

[musical example]

Many editions use the two-bar rest (as in the previous example) and the all-purpose multiple-rest symbol for all rests greater than two bars (see trumpet example, above).

Place the numeral indicating the number of bars' rest above the stave, except where a shortage of vertical space (e.g. coinciding with a tempo change) makes it more convenient to place the numeral below the stave. Multiple-rest bars should be divided in the following circumstances:

**TABLE 1: Dividing multiple rests**

A time-signature change:
[musical example]

A tempo change:
[musical example]

A pause bar:
[musical example]

A G.P. bar:
[musical example]

A rehearsal mark:
[musical example]

According to available space, multiple-rest bars may be of any convenient length on a given stave. It is helpful visually for successive bars to be relatively longer or shorter according to their duration. However, when spacing is tight, consecutive bars may be of equal length, regardless of the number of bars they represent. (In traditional engraving, a rest bar takes the space the graphic symbol needs: thus, multiple-rest bar symbols measuring equal graphic length take equal space. This layout is not recommended.)

Relative spacing is also helpful for reading single-bar rests of different time signatures (see oboe example, p. 559).

A single bar's rest is best numbered as '1', so that it is not misread for a multiple rest. Omit the '1' when a pause is present, and when a cue is added. The '1' may be omitted wherever a single bar has a G.P. indication (see Silent bars (G.P.), p. 190).

## Providing cues

A cue may fulfil several functions: it may be used for orientation; for tuning or for co-ordination (see Cue stave, p. 575); or to indicate a line that is to be played in the absence of, or to support, other forces (see Playing cues, p. 498).

### For orientation

The number of bars' rest a player can reasonably be expected to count between entries without a cue depends on the complexity of the music. If in doubt, add a cue. The more complex the music, the greater the need for cues — even after only a few bars' rest.

A cue is essential before an important solo entry, so that the soloist has utmost confidence that the entry will be correctly placed.

Cues are useful after a change of tempo, so that the players can confirm correct counting in the new tempo, not (say) at half or double speed.

In long rest periods cues also provide landmarks (e.g. at section changes).

Provide plenty of cues in rhythmically complex music, in situations in which co-ordination will be difficult and when the pulse is inaudible.

In unconducted music, for security it may be very useful to provide a virtually continuous cue line during rest bars, so that the player does not have to rely solely on accurate counting.

### What to cue

Selecting the most useful cue is an important aspect of preparing a part. Consider which type of cue is most helpful according to the most prominent features of the music, and combine any of the following options. A metre change or a G.P. bar indication helps players to identify their places and this may obviate the need for a cue.

#### Melodic line
A melodic line provides an ideal cue:

- except when the line is too fast for the player to follow
- except when pitch is not a prominent feature of the material
- except when pitch clusters make an individual line difficult to hear

In these cases a rhythm is likely to be a more suitable cue (see below).

Select a cue that will definitely be audible to the player. This is more important than cueing the most musically significant entry. If in doubt, cue the line of a player sitting in close proximity. In a theatre pit, a player in the middle of the group may not hear a cue from a player seated at the side.

When there is a choice of cues, select a line with similar rhythmic material to the player's entry:

[musical example]

Note that chords are not useful as cues — it is the cue entry that is important.

#### Rhythm
A rhythm alone is an appropriate cue when the material is predominantly rhythmic rather than melodic in character. Select, for example, the rhythm of a group of instruments playing in rhythmic unison. The rhythm may be cued either as notes placed just above the stave, or as stems without noteheads (although rhythms that have noteheads are easier to read). It is useful to distinguish a percussion cue by using crossed noteheads:

[musical example]

(See also Rhythmic cue line, p. 576.)

#### Indication of prominent entries

Prominent entries are useful markers during long rest periods and preceding a melodic or rhythmic cue. Indicate the instrument or section abbreviation under the bar in which it enters. If necessary, divide multiple-rest bars to do this. Vocal or choral entries may also be indicated in this way.

In rhythmically complex music, it is useful for the player to know when the part is in rhythmic or melodic unison with another player. This is marked 'col . . .' or 'with . . .' at the entry, usually below the stave and after any dynamic:

[musical example]

#### Cue from a soloist, singer or speaker

Such a cue should be a last resort — either when there is no alternative cue, or when the instrument's entry depends on it: the soloist or singers may not be present at the first rehearsals. Furthermore, when, in performance, a singer or speaker is positioned at the front of the stage and the players behind, the players may not be able to hear the cue.

In a work for small ensemble, a soloist is likely to be present at initial rehearsals and therefore such a cue is appropriate.

Text for a vocal cue is placed below the stave. It must be distinguished from text instructions, either by using a smaller text size or by underlining. If there is more than one line of text, only the lowest line needs to be underlined (underlining is helpful to unify a text that otherwise appears fragmented on the page, but should be omitted if such a line parallel to the stave is distracting):

[musical example]

#### Cues to avoid
An instrument that may be imported only for a final rehearsal should not be used as a cue.

A repeated pattern is a dangerous cue, and may be confusing rather than helpful. Instead, select a cue that sounds once only. If repeated material is the only available melodic or rhythmic cue, indications of prominent entries may be more useful.

### Extent of a cue

Give several bars of a cue before an entry. A distinctive entry a few bars before the player's next entry is better than a cue so close to the entry that a player has no time to remedy any miscounting. If necessary, cue more than one instrument to make a decent length of cue. The cue need not continue as far as the entry point if it has no further valuable rhythmic content:

[musical example]

When a cue unfolds into long, sustained notes it ceases to be useful. However, a succession of sustained-note entries can be combined to make up a sufficient melodic cue (see Passage of sustained-note entries, p. 572).

The most helpful cue is a short cue of a significant entry. A very long cue can be distracting and makes counting more difficult. A cue such as the 19 bars in the trombone part, from Bruckner's Symphony No. 9 (see p. 571), should be given only when the material is repetitive (each statement of the material is cued for safety) and when there are no other significant landmarks.

## Cue notation

### Size and spacing

Cue notation is about three-quarters the size of full-sized notation, so that it is conspicuously smaller than the player's material. All notation symbols that are part of the cue (including rests, accidentals, articulation and dynamics) are scaled down. Stem lengths are 2-2½ stave-spaces long. Cue notes are usually slightly larger than grace notes (stem lengths of both tend to be the same).

Ledger lines for cue notes should be the same vertical distance apart as full-sized ledger lines (although they are thinner) since it is important that cue notes are on the same level above or below the stave as full-sized notes.

Note spacing should be closed up within a cue: space characters in proportion to the reduced note size. Condensed horizontal spacing is good visual identification of a cue.

### Cue content

Apart from an indication of instrumentation, pitch and rhythmic information is usually all that is needed from a cue.

Omit dynamics, articulation and phrasing except when they are important in the context, e.g. when they signal a change of texture.

Ensure that harmonics (strings, harp and guitar) are notated at actual, not fingered, pitch.

At a page-turn, place a cue after (not before) it, so that the player has time to turn and then prepare for the next entry while reading the cue.

(See also Playing cues, p. 498.)

### Labelling cues

Indicate the cued instrument or voice as an abbreviation at the stem end of the cue, above the stave for cues with conventional stem direction. Indicate instrumental changes during a cue, using the '+' sign for additional instruments:

[musical example]

### Stem direction

There are two layout options, depending on available surrounding space.

#### 1. Cue-stems reversed away from the stave

This layout requires plenty of space. It should be used in a hand-copied part and when a cue is required in the same bar as the player's entry (see Cue in the same bar as the player's entry, p. 571). Opposite stem direction clearly differentiates a cue from played notes.

A cue lying predominantly high on the stave takes up-stems; a cue low on the stave takes down-stems. Reverse ties (and slurs, if included) away from the stave. Place tuplet indications, articulation and dynamics (if used) outside the stave.

Keep the stems of the same cue (i.e. of the same instrument) in one direction. A second cue before the same entry can take opposite stem direction should its range fall in a different part of the stave (see oboe example, p. 568).

#### 2. Cue-stems with ordinary stem direction

This option saves vertical space in cramped conditions. If necessary, both up- and down-stems can be combined in one cue (see flute example, above): ordinary stem direction can be used for cue notes on ledger lines, while notes that fall within the stave take opposite stem direction to the player's line.

(See also Cue bars without rests, below.)

### Whole-bar rests

In general, it is easiest to count cue bars that contain whole-bar rests: the rests clarify the number of bars at a glance. For a very long cue it is helpful to number the rest bars (see following example). Where the cue follows on from a multiple-rest bar, it is helpful to continue the numbering from such a point (see also horn example, p. 572).

Rests are full-sized. When cue stems are reversed away from the stave, position the rests as in conventional two-part writing (see Placing rests in double-stemmed writing, p. 36).

Where possible, keep a succession of displaced whole-bar rests on the same stave-line, as this is easiest to read. (Many editions place the rests no closer to the cue than the top and bottom stave lines; others merely avoid the middle stave-line.) Place rests on ledger lines for bars in which they would otherwise collide with a cue. Move rests back to the edge of the stave for subsequent bars:

[musical example]

When a cue takes ordinary stem direction, whole-bar rests can be placed on the stave on either side of the cue (see flute example, above).

#### Cue bars without rests

Rests may be omitted from cue bars that have ordinary stem direction. This option is useful in music of already dense texture, where extra whole-bar rests would further clutter the stave.

There must be sufficient contrast in size between cue and full-sized notes so that it is absolutely clear that the cue should not be played:

[musical example]

In hand-copied parts, cues should always take rests, as the difference between cued and played notes may not otherwise be sufficiently obvious.

### Cue in the same bar as the player's entry

Unless it is important to follow through a cue right up to an entry (e.g. to show how the player continues a phrase), finish a cue in the previous bar, so as not to obscure the entry.

A cue may finish with an open tie, to avoid a tied cue-note in the entry bar (see following example (a); see also Open ties, below).

When a cue occurs in the same bar as the subsequent entry, give rests for the playing line up to its entry. The cue does not take rests to make up the value of the bar once the player has started.

The duration of the cue's last note may overlap with the player's line (b) but it is easier to read the rhythm if the cue is shortened so that it does not overlap (c).

Allocate the player's line its own accidentals — those of a cue may be overlooked (b). Where appropriate, accidentals for a cue should be cancelled for the playing line, to avoid confusion (c):

[musical example]

### Open ties

#### Passage of sustained-note entries
A succession of sustained-note staggered entries may take the form of a melodic cue. Each sustained value is replaced by an open tie at the entry of the next instrument (see example below). The open tie indicates that the sustained note continues.

(See also Open ties, p. 72.)

#### Starting a cue with a tied note
When it is convenient to start a cue mid-phrase, e.g. after a long tied note, it may begin with the tied note:

[musical example]

### Clefs for cues

It is best to notate a cue in the player's current clef, especially when the cue is short. Should this require many ledger lines, transpose the cue one or more octaves and indicate the octave transposition. The resulting notation is less cluttered and thus quicker to read:

[musical example]

Extended cues, or a series of cues, may change more conveniently to treble or bass clef, in order to save adding many 8va indications. However, never introduce a cue in the alto or tenor clef for an instrument that uses neither of these clefs.

#### Positioning clef changes

The cue clef is the same size as a mid-system clef: about two-thirds of the full-sized clef (see Changing clef, p. 7).

The cue clef should be as close to its cue notes as possible. Thus, where a bar has a new key signature or time signature, place the cue clef after these changes (see position of bass clef in the following example (a) and (b)).

When a cue begins immediately after the barline, place the cue clef before the barline (c).

When rests precede a cue at the beginning of a bar, the clef may be placed after the rests so that it remains close to its cue (e).

It is good practice to retain the player's clef at the beginning of the stave at all times — a flute part that appears to begin in the bass clef does not inspire confidence. The cue clef always comes afterwards, as at (a).

Reinstate the player's clef before an entry. Where the next entry is at the beginning of a line, add a cautionary clef for the player at the end of the previous line (d):

[musical example]

By contrast, where a cue begins at the start of a line, no warning cue clef need be given on the previous line.

### Transposition

A cue should be transposed into the key of the playing instrument, as if the player is to play the cue. This enables a player to blend with the cued pitch (see example below).

A player who doubles on an instrument of different transposition must have cues correctly transposed into the key of the instrument of the following entry, i.e. after the change of instrument instruction. For example, an oboe part doubling cor anglais should have cues written at concert pitch before oboe entries. Cues before cor anglais entries should be written in F.

A new key signature for the different transposition should coincide with an instrument-change instruction (see oboe example, p. 559). Alternatively, if the new instrument enters after a change of musical section and there is no previous cue, it is sensible to commence the new key signature with the new section (i.e. after a thin double barline, if one is present).

### Cues and octave-transposing instruments

For instruments that sound at a different octave from their written pitch, such as piccolo and double bass, cue pitches should be notated at the octave at which they appear in the score. A cue of an octave-transposing instrument (such as the piccolo cue, below) is notated at written pitch — again, as it appears in a score — so as to avoid the ledger lines that would be necessary if it were notated at sounding pitch. (In the horn part below, the piccolo notes are transposed into F, following the octave of the score's written piccolo pitches.)

Do not indicate octave signs other than to give the correct written octave for the cue — see the following double bass part:

[musical example]

The use of octave-transposing clefs for cues adds unnecessary information to the part; such clefs also need to be replaced with ordinary clefs for the playing instrument, further cluttering the music. Omit these extra clefs:

[musical example]

If a player's line uses octave-transposing clefs (e.g. a piccolo or double bass line), it is unnecessary to add ordinary clefs for a cue — it is assumed that the cue is notated as written in the score.

## Cue stave

### When to use a cue stave

A cue stave allows for cues simultaneous with the player's line. A cue stave is essential for synchronising the following:

- accompanied recitative (cue both vocal line and text for the duration of the recitative)
- unconducted music of complex co-ordination
- parts with individual metre or tempo (see Non-coinciding barlines, p. 577)
- parts with complete rhythmic independence (see Independent parts within an ensemble, p. 613)
- parts without metre or with independent ensemble (see Indicating synchronization (Unmeasured bars and independent ensemble), p. 616; also, Proportional spacing: Cues in instrumental parts, p. 639)
- parts with independent repetition (see Independent repetition: Cues in instrumental parts, p. 627)

A cue stave is also used to notate alternative material for passages of exceptional technical difficulty (see Practical alternatives to technical difficulties, p. 497), and, in string writing, to indicate sounding pitches that differ from written pitches (see Harmonics: Indicating sounding pitches, p. 421, and Scordatura, p. 424).

### Layout

A cue stave is about three-quarters of the full-sized stave. It is usually placed above the player's line, in order to be clear of the player's dynamics.

Include the cue stave or line only for as many bars as necessary — it may start and finish at any point on the system. At the beginning of the system it is joined to the player's stave by a systemic barline. Where barlines coincide, join the cue and the player's stave together with dotted or solid barlines, for clarity (end of last bar, below). Since so few barlines coincide in the section below, solid barlines are used, to be most conspicuous:

[musical example]

Tempi and rehearsal marks should appear above the cue stave.

Include a cue stave only when there is essential interaction between performers that requires them to see each other's lines; once a player has started playing, a cue stave creates a plethora of information on the page that can distract the player.

Use only a single cue stave. Simultaneous entries of more than one instrument can be cued, if necessary, by using opposite stem directions. However, a judicious selection of short cue entries is usually better than a virtual short score of the other lines — which is likely to render the cue too dense to be read easily.

### Rhythmic cue line

A rhythm cue pares information to a minimum and is very economical of space. It is often possible to fit in a rhythm cue (with or without a stave line) where there would be no room for a cue stave. The rhythm cue will show how two parts interact rhythmically, which is usually all that is required of a cue. A rhythm cue is particularly suitable where the player already has a complex part and cannot afford to be distracted by more than a minimum of cue information.

A rhythmic cue line may alternate with a cue stave if some melodic indication is required in other places.

A cue from a second instrument takes opposite stem direction (see bar 3, below). If two instruments alternate in a cue, this saves labelling each entry, thus making the cue line less cluttered.

During rests, a cue may move to the player's stave, and back to the cue stave (or line) at the player's entry. Add a dotted diagonal line to show where the cue moves:

[musical example]

(See also example under Conductor signals in instrumental parts, p. 618.)

The parts of Elliott Carter's chamber music pieces frequently use rhythmic cue lines simultaneously with the playing part, often for space-saving reasons: see, for example, Duo for violin and piano, the String Quartets and the Brass Quintet.

### Non-coinciding barlines

A continuous cue stave may be used to show how parts co-ordinate when they have different bar lengths (see Ravel example, above). The cue shows the intended rhythmic alignment between parts by providing the necessary information of the simultaneous metre. (See also the extract from Bliss's Oboe Quintet, p. 176: this extract could function as a cello part, the stave above being a cue, since it provides the necessary information of the simultaneous metre; see also Polymetre, p. 174.)

Often a cue line of rhythm is all that is necessary.

#### Repetition in independent metre or tempo
When a player repeats material strictly in time but in an independent metre or tempo, it may be useful to show the exact relationship of the part to the ensemble's bars. This is so that the player can measure the part against it and know when to move on. It may be sufficient to indicate merely the ensemble's barring. However, a written cue towards the end of the repetition sequence is likely to be helpful. Place the cue on a separate cue stave or line — but not on the player's own stave — so that the barlines of each are clear. (When the independent part has a separate metre from the ensemble, indicating both on the player's stave is confusing as the player is likely to lose the place if the repeat barlines do not coincide with those of the ensemble.)

[musical example]

(See also Independent repetition: Cueing the metred ensemble's barlines, p. 628.)

## Repeated bars

It is best to notate bars of repeated material in full in an instrumental part, if there is room, so that the eye can travel forward with each bar. However, bars of very simple material may use the one-bar or two-bar repeat signs. If the material is complex and repeat-bar signs (:‖:) are used, there is a serious risk that players may miscount if they must look back to the beginning of the line as well as follow the music forward.

It is very helpful to number bars of repeated material, whether the material is notated in full or with repeat-bar signs. The first statement of the material is labelled '1'. Never number the first repeat as '1': this is very confusing for the player, who is playing the material for the second time.

If the repeat-bar sign is used, notate the repeat in full for the first bar of each system but number consecutively from the first statement of the material:

[musical example]

In a braced part, use repeat-bar signs only when the material repeats on both staves since otherwise it is too confusing for the player:

[musical example]

(See also Repeated bars, p. 231.)

It is helpful to number bars of a single sustained or repeated note. In an extended passage, every four bars (or the appropriate phrase length) may be sufficient:

[musical example]

(For use of repeat-bar signs in a percussion part, see Percussion, p. 586.)

## Repeated sections

Repeated section in instrumental parts must correspond exactly with the layout of a score. Parts must have the same number of notated bars as a score and repeats must occur in identical places in all material, to avoid confusion during rehearsal. Do not create a repeat section in an instrumental part that is notated in full in a score as consecutive bars; use the repeat-bar sign (:‖:) instead:

[musical example]

Repeated sections should correspond with score layout even where some players have rests. For example, two repeated sections of eight bars each should not be amalgamated into one 16-bar repeat (see following example).

First- and second-time bars that occur in a score should be written into all performers' parts even where they have rests or where no variation occurs in their repeat. This is so that there can be no confusion when a first- or second-time bar is a starting point in rehearsal:

[musical example]

### Multiple-repeat sections
When material is to be repeated several times and all performers have identical lengths and numbers of repeats, repeat barlines may frame one or more bars of repetition in place of consecutive bars. Performance of such repetition requires greater concentration than when material is written out as consecutive bars, since the eye cannot travel forwards with each bar. For rehearsal purposes it is essential that the repeats coincide in all printed parts:

[musical example]

(See also Independent repetition: Duration of repetition, p. 624.)

## Tacet

The direction tacet ('it is silent', plural tacent) obviates the need to notate rests in the following contexts.

When a player does not play for a whole movement this is indicated, for instance, Movement II - tacet. When a subsequent movement follows on without a break, and a player is to play at the start of the movement, it is necessary to indicate the length of the previous one. In this case tacet should not be used; the duration of the movement must be indicated by rests, providing all rehearsal marks, time signature and key changes, and with cues as appropriate.

When a player has finished playing for the remainder of a piece, this is indicated tacet al fine. For orientation in rehearsal, place the instruction after a subsequent rehearsal mark:

[musical example]

When a player has a long rest period in the middle of a movement, do not replace multiple-rest bars with tacet: even with cues included before a subsequent entry, the player would have no idea when to expect those cues.

## Accidentals

When single-player parts are extracted from a score in which a stave contains two or more lines, accidentals used to confirm the pitch of a note in one voice that had been altered for another voice (marked †) may become redundant:

[musical example]

(See also Accidentals relevant to more than one part on a stave, p. 79.)

### Enharmonic note-spelling

In tonal music, the written pitches in a part should agree with the key of the piece and its modulations: it is not helpful to 'simplify' modulations to remote keys by changing the note-spelling from that in the score if this obscures the harmonic sense. (The case may be different for a transposed part — see Enharmonic key changes and Enharmonic note-spelling, pp. 252-3.)

In both tonal and non-tonal music, the tendency to spell chords in a score vertically to clarify their harmonic sense may produce awkward intervals for the individual performer reading only their own line. Such vertical spelling should be relinquished in favour of linear melodic spelling, ideally in both score and instrumental part (see Note-spelling, p. 85).

## Combined-instrument parts

### Duets

A piece for two players is usually written on one printed part, since it is important for each player to see how the lines interact at all times. Both players have a stave each throughout. A duet part may be useful also for two players in chamber music (e.g. for the violinist and cellist of a piano trio) for the same reason, provided that page-turns are possible for each player. (For an example of duet layout, see example for two flutes, p. 583.)

### Woodwind and brass

In orchestral music, it is usual for each player to have an individual printed part, even though lines of two or more players may be combined onto one stave in a score to save space.

Pairs of the same instrument may be combined onto a single part:

- when one instrument has only very occasional entries
- in a piece of predominantly dovetailed entries between the pair of instruments
- in a work specifically designed for amateurs

In these cases it is useful for each player to see how the two lines interact, and to have the music of their neighbouring player as a cue.

A combined part may be less convenient for a long work, due to the likely increase in number of page-turns.

Each player should have a separate stave unless the lines are in melodic unison or one is silent for extended periods: it is distracting for players to read a line other than their own on the same stave.

A single stave should not be shared between two players playing differently transposed instruments simultaneously — e.g. a flute part in which the second player is playing piccolo. (Where the two instruments have different transpositions throughout, it is better for them not to share a part.)

So that it is absolutely clear who is to play, a single stave must be labelled for each entry: by player number, or with a 2 for a unison.

### Multiple-player parts

This section refers to an instrumental part that may be played by an unspecified number of the same instrument: a predominantly single-line part with occasional division. This layout is standard practice in multiple-player wind band parts (see Instrumental parts, p. 545). In brass band music, the copy for the four solo cornets is also a combined part (see Instrumental parts, p. 548). All players play from the same (duplicated) copy.

In melodic unison, write the multiple-instrument part as a single line. Assign it a unison indication after a division (see example below).

#### Divided line on a single stave
When a line divides, it is best to place each division on a separate stave. However, to save space in order to facilitate a feasible page-turn, two divisions may share a stave for an occasional short phrase as long as the lines are predominantly in rhythmic unison, they do not overlap and they share dynamics. Where space is very limited, an isolated short phrase divided into three is also acceptable on a single stave. The lines may share stems, phrasing and articulation:

[musical example]

It is a false economy to put a divided line onto a single stave if it is difficult to work out which pitches. This layout will only increase the danger of performance error; passages in close position are particularly tricky to read:

[musical example]

Single- and double-stave layout may be alternated on one part as necessary.

### Layout of combined-instrument parts

Bracket together and bar through the two or more staves of the system: this clarifies the system breaks (see example below).

On the first divided system, label each stave by player number or division in the margin (see Violin I's part in example Score and part: comparative layout, p. 585); the labelling is unnecessary if two parts appear on two staves throughout — as might be the case in the example for two flutes, below. Thereafter labelling is required only at a change of division or layout.

Give tempo indications and rehearsal marks once, above the top stave.

Assign dynamics to each stave. A player is used to seeing dynamics below the stave, and may fail to notice if they are placed between the staves, to be shared with the line above (as might be used in a score).

Provide technical instructions and numerals for multiple-rest bars above each stave so that they are not overlooked.

A cue is required on one stave only (usually the upper stave):

[musical example]

### Divided string lines

In a conventional orchestral set-up, each string member (1st Violin, 2nd Violin, viola, cello and bass sections) is laid out on one part regardless of the number of divisions and solos. However, when a piece is scored for double string orchestra or a set-up where some players will be seated separately (e.g. off-stage players), each group has independent printed parts.

When a multi-divided part requires separate staves for individual lines, it may be that only a few bars will fit onto a double-page spread. In this exceptional circumstance, to avoid frequent page-turns, divide the section into two or more separate parts, e.g. one copy for each desk or pairs of desks. Clearly mark the front of each part: for instance, Violin II, desk 2 (see Player allocation, p. 429).

#### Divided line on a single stave
A string division may be placed on one stave when the writing is straightforward. The same provisos apply as for any multiple-player part (see Divided line on a single stave, p. 582). Division must always be labelled, to avoid ambiguity with multiple-stopping (see Divided string ensemble, p. 428).

Stem each line separately, to distinguish division from double-stopping (single stems for two lines are permissible only in a full score):

[musical example]

Allocate each line a separate stave for an extended division, and where the lines are not in rhythmic unison, since bowing marks and bowing slurs are difficult to read for down-stemmed notes (see Bowing marks, p. 405).

For an extended division into three (i.e. more than the occasional chord), place two lines on one stave, the third on a separate stave.

#### Stave layout for divisions

Single-stave and multiple-stave systems can be interchanged as necessary.

A player should never be asked to move stave mid-system. When divided and unison writing alternates during a system, duplicate the unison writing on all staves so that no player needs to swap stave. The following shorthand notation for a unison passage is a time-saving device acceptable only in a composer's full-score sketch:

[musical example]

A part may require a different layout from the score. A typical example is a change from div. a 2 to div. a 3. Arrange the part so that it takes account of all division permutations for the length of a system. This may entail further subdividing one of the lines to allow the different divisions to have balanced forces. In the following example, division into three is calculated from the beginning of the system. The middle line of the three divides into two, to allow equal numbers of players to take both musical lines for the division into two:

[musical example]

When a division of the section subdivides, add a further div. indication. If legible, keep the subdivision on one stave, so as to use a minimum number of staves (see following example).

A solo line takes a separate stave at the top of the section. Include a stave for a solo line for a complete system, even when a solo joins other players, so that the solo player is not required to change stave mid-system. When there are more than two staves to a system, solo staves may be barred separately from the rest of the section, in order to separate them visually. Bracket all staves together at the beginning of the system.

It is helpful to label a complex set-up (such as below) on each system, so that players can identify their lines quickly. Mid-system, mark a division change between the staves:

[musical example]

## Percussion

Players who need to locate different instruments, reposition themselves and their music for a change of instrument, change sticks, damp resonances, watch the conductor and occasionally look at their copies, need all the help they can to read their music as easily as possible. They may need to read the copy at an oblique angle or even over their shoulder.

Use a generous stave size for percussion parts, since the music stand may be some distance from the player. Do not use too large a page size, since copies may need to be transferred from stand to stand in performance.

Ensure that the notation is as straightforward as possible. Keep written instructions to a minimum, and avoid elaborate symbols (see Using symbols, p. 275).

Repeat-bar signs: A percussion part is not a licence to use repeat-bar notation at all times. Except for the repetition of the simplest rhythms, use repeat-bar signs (:‖:) sparingly. Numbering bars of repeated material minimises the time necessary to look at the copy (see marimba example, p. 588).

The basic principle of laying out a percussion part of more than one instrument is to distribute instruments amongst a minimum number of players (see Allocating instruments to players, p. 271).

Where possible write all instruments for one player on one stave or a group of lines (see Layout of instruments of definite and indefinite pitch for one player, p. 287; also, Instruments of indefinite pitch, p. 278; for tuned percussion instruments, see Number of staves for one player, p. 276).

### Timpani

In an orchestral piece the timpanist has an individual part separate from other percussionists. An orchestral timpanist rarely doubles any percussion instruments, although a percussion player may play a second set of timpani. In this case the second set of drums is written into the relevant percussion, not timpani, part.

### Percussion playing score or individual parts

The player assigned to a single instrument throughout has an individual part. Otherwise, in the first instance, the safest option is to group all the percussion into a playing score, provided that page-turning is possible for all players (see Percussion playing-score layout, below). Once the instrument distribution has been seen to work, or reworked as necessary, then individual parts can be created for the future.

When it is not possible to find page-turns for all players at the same time, the playing score should be divided up so that two or three players share a part, e.g. one part for players 1 and 2, one for players 3 and 4, etc.

The advantages of a playing score are that the players can then rearrange the instrument allocation or assign some instruments to an extra player (if available), and all lines function as cues for each other.

A potential problem is frequent page-turns. This is unhelpful to a player who may be some distance from the music stand, the other side of a large assortment of instruments. Note that to turn a page with two or more sticks in each hand takes three times longer than normal. Additionally, a player may have a second copy for use at a different group of instruments and therefore need to turn two copies during a rest.

Another drawback is that once a playing score has many staves, the distraction of so much information outweighs the benefit of having the other lines as cues.

Percussion ensemble: In a work for percussion ensemble, allocate each player a separate part. When two players play the same instrument together (e.g. a large keyboard-percussion instrument), then these two players have a combined part. Ensure correct labelling of such a copy, e.g. 'Marimba (2 players)'; the indication 'Marimba 1 and 2' would suggest two instruments.

#### Percussion playing-score layout

Allocate each player a separate stave or group of lines and place these in player order (see Score order of players, p. 272). Never change the stave order as each player identifies his or her line from its relative position within the system. Therefore, ideally, keep a line or stave for each player throughout. If it is necessary to condense the layout to help page-turning, resting players' staves or lines may have to be deleted; this is acceptable as long as each stave is given a player number throughout.

Organize the layout of the playing score as a combined-instrumental copy (see p. 583). It is particularly important that barlines and margin brackets join the staves or lines of all players, to clarify the system breaks: it is more difficult to identify system breaks where systems comprise three or four staves. However, when several players each have more than a single stave or group of lines, it may be more useful to separate barlines between players, to clarify the distribution of lines (see Sample percussion score, p. 272).

### Cues

Cue instruments that are close to hand (e.g. keyboards): percussionists may be a good distance behind the rest of the orchestra. Cue another percussion entry only if that instrument is unique to the passage: e.g. do not cue a tam-tam stroke if three players each play a tam-tam in the same passage. A cue midway through a long section of repeated material is useful (indication of an instrument entry or where another player stops may be sufficient):
