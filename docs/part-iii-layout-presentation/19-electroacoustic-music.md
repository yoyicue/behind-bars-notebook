# 19. Electroacoustic Music

## Introduction

Electronic components are playing an increasingly important role in the twenty-first century and raise particular notational issues. Increasingly, new technological developments enable composers to work with sophisticated live synthesis and transformation of sounds using computers. It is a rapidly developing area and new works often present new notational issues. This chapter will seek to establish some general principles using illustrations from existing practice.

Various terms are used to describe the musicians or sound engineers who perform the electroacoustic element of a work. The roles may vary and overlap and there is little standardization in terminology. In the context of this chapter, the term technician defines the role — although often great musicality is required of the electroacoustic performer. Performer or acoustic performer defines a musician playing an acoustic instrument or singing. Sometimes the acoustic performer may also be involved in realizing aspects of the electroacoustic element, e.g. triggering changes using a footpedal.

## Equipment

Provide a detailed list of the equipment required for the performance. Diagrams explaining how equipment is to be set up can often play a vital role.

In the preface to the score and to any separate technical copies (e.g. for a synthesizer), specify:

- the complete technical requirements for a piece
- the number of technicians required
- where essential, the precise make and model of synthesizer or processing equipment
- otherwise, general information about the type of synthesizer, the keyboard range, the number and type of controllers (e.g. velocity-sensitive keyboard, pitch-bend wheel, after-touch), and footpedals
- where computers are used, full details of the required specification of both hardware and software
- a diagram explaining how the equipment is to be set up
- a diagram indicating the layout of loudspeakers and the position of the mixing desk and performers in the hall (optional)

(A model of good practice is to be found in IRCAM's specifications, available as separate documents, which give detailed information on its commissions.)

## Amount and type of notation for the score

The appropriate amount and type of information depends on the function of the score.

### Score for study and analysis

As a record of the content of a work, information may be as detailed as the composer wishes. A graphic description may be useful for sound-diffusion purposes, even when there is no live instrumentalist or singer (see, for instance, Stockhausen's Telemusik).

### Score as a performance tool

The function of notating electroacoustic sounds (either pre-recorded or processed live) is to describe them with as many points of reference as are necessary to co-ordinate performers and the electronic component, and/or to give all necessary information to the technician.

Traditional notation or graphic illustration is often of most help (see below). Graphic display of the audio waveform is usually unhelpful, as it gives no indication of timbre or pitch content.

Keep information to a minimum. It is important not to overload a score with detailed information that will confuse performers. Only for complex interaction between performer and electronic sounds might it be appropriate to include elaborate detail.

The recommendations in this chapter are intended primarily for notation as a performance tool.

## Notation and co-ordination

Where performers do not interact with pre-recorded material (fixed media), representation of the electronic sounds can be minimal. The technician activating the recording needs to know:

- where to start and to stop the recording
- how long the recording lasts
- the dynamics, to balance with acoustic instruments or voices (see Dynamics for electronic sounds, p. 598)

The basic notational requirement is, therefore, duration. It is simplest to indicate this (and to read it) as a continuous band (a straight or wavy line) on a single- or five-line stave. If helpful, add a verbal description of the electronic sounds (see following example).

To make the starting and stopping points of a recording obvious, centre opening and closing brackets on the stave. All CD tracks or individual sound files must be numbered, and numerals framed clearly above the stave (① below = Track 1):

[musical example]

When performers require cues or must synchronize with a recording or live processing, provide notation of significant events. The most appropriate notation depends on the nature of the music and the type of co-ordination required.

### Rhythm and pitch cues

Distinctive rhythmic and pitched materials are the clearest cues. Where rhythms would be the most helpful element, providing pitches may be irrelevant. (To provide an indication of pitch contour, see Options to show approximate pitch, p. 640). Description is simplified by replacing the five-line stave with one (or more) lines. Different notehead shapes may indicate contrasting textures. The line (or lines) may alternate with a five-line stave, should selected sections be notated more helpfully as pitched material. Pitched cues may be necessary only where the performer has to tune to the electronic part (bar 2, below).

Large dense chords can provide too much information and may be replaced by a single melodic line or even rhythms alone. For example, Harvey's Bhakti, movement II, deals with such chords in precisely this way (the following bars 1-2 have similar notation):

[musical example]

Saariaho's Jardin Secret II for harpsichord and electronics and Harvey's Advaya for cello and electronics are good models of appropriate information required from an electronic cue. In the Saariaho extract (p. 600), rhythm cues predominate and pitches are notated only where they are important as a cue (see 3'44"); contrasting graphics portray different timbres. In the Harvey extract (p. 606), minimum information in the CD parts is sufficient for orientation and as an indication of content for the technician.

Complex interaction may require a greater level of detail, but only in such circumstances should elaborate descriptions of sounds be given; otherwise it can be difficult to pick out the information that is really important.

### Proportional spacing

Proportional spacing may be an ideal notation for electronic sounds, especially where there is no discernible pulse, where the material does not fit into conventional metrical patterns, and where it is inappropriate to notate complex metrical patterns (see Proportional spacing, p. 629). If time-space notation can simplify an electronic part, this helps the musicians, who may need to follow it at the same time as reading their own lines (or the score).

The appropriate notation depends on its function. If it is important to indicate sustained duration (e.g. for tuning), use extenders after noteheads (see example under MIDI sequence as cues, p. 602). If only the timing of events is important, stemless noteheads are efficient notation:

[musical example]

(See Proportional spacing: Notation options, p. 631; see also the Harvey extract, p. 606, where the notation of the CD1 part is spaced proportionally)

### Graphic illustration

Simple graphic illustration may be used for describing notation elements — pitch, rhythm, texture (a complex sound of many components) and other aspects of the sound — that would otherwise be too complex or even impossible to describe by conventional means, or when it would be inappropriate or burdensome to do so. Uncomplicated graphics can be quicker to read than either a stave of conventional notation or verbal description, although brief verbal description enables the eye to relate the graphics to the sonority.

Graphic illustration is efficient for describing contrasting and changing timbre (i.e. modification of a single sonority), since there is no traditional notation to indicate how sound is changed in this way. Illustrate duration of textures, pitch or other aspects of the sound as horizontal bands on a stave or between a grid of two lines using proportional spacing principles. The width of the band should reflect pitch range (high frequency at the top); changing pitch spectra can be reflected by changing the band's contours. The band may be filled in with lines, cross-hatching or other patterns so that each pattern can represent a different texture. Changes in pattern density can reflect changing density of texture (see section 0-10", below); changing patterns can reflect changes to the quality of the sound (15-25"):

[musical example]

To avoid anything other than minimal verbal description in the score itself, define the representation of particular textures in a preface. Too much description in an electronic part that functions primarily as a cue for co-ordination is distracting.

(See also Symbols to replace repeated instructions, p. 494; also, Timings for pre-recorded material, p. 600.)

Where there is room, simultaneous different timbres may be represented on separate staves or lines. This separation enables sounds to be illustrated in different ways on the different staves or lines, e.g. combining conventional notation with graphics, if appropriate (see Different timbres/textures, layout (c), p. 597). In the extract from Harvey's Advaya (p. 606), the CD2 part presents in simple graphic form varying intensity of granulated reverberation: by placing a single wavy line on the stave after the established pitches, the density of the curves corresponds to the varying intensity of the reverberation; the more compressed shapes represent greater intensity (resulting in a louder dynamic).

## Layout of the electronic component

In a score, the most appropriate position for an electronic part and any verbal specifications depend on the function of the information.

### Bottom of the system

The bottom of a system is always the most conspicuous place for copious technical information (if needed). Place the electronic part in this position, below the staves of acoustic performers:

- when it is primarily a set of instructions for the technician (including amplification)
- when an ensemble work contains a detailed or dense pre-recorded part: the electronic part is then visually separated from the ensemble texture
- in a piece for electronics and one or two performers in which the performers play from the score; the performers' lines are clearest to read at the top of the system, and best placed directly below tempi and rehearsal marks

### Middle of the system

When electronic sounds are generated via a trigger from an acoustic instrument (including an electronic keyboard), there is an obvious advantage in placing resultant sounds (if notated) on staves adjacent to — usually below — those of the appropriate acoustic performer. Thus the technician and conductor (if the work is conducted) can see how to balance the sound while following the individual parts (for illustration of layout, see example Different timbres/textures, opposite).

A keyboard trigger part is normally placed in the score position of an ordinary keyboard part. This might well be in the middle of the score. However, when a score requires detailed description of an electronic part, consider placing both the trigger and the resultant-sounds staves at the bottom of the score for the reasons given above. (See also Trigger keyboard, p. 601.)

Instructions for the technician relating to the trigger instrument that consequently appear in the middle of a score system should be boxed, to be clearly visible (see fader instructions in electronic keyboard example, p. 599).

### Layout in a part

When ensemble players have individual instrumental parts and require intermittent cues of electronic sounds, place these cues in normal cue position, i.e. above a player's own line (see Cue stave: Layout, p. 575).

### Brackets

Join together all lines or staves of the electronic part with a margin bracket (see Score brackets and barlines, p. 514). Even a single line or stave may take a bracket to make its position more conspicuous (see (a) below).

Choose a curly brace to join staves of like material (b), a square bracket for staves of different timbres or textures (c). Material of a particular type may be grouped with a sub-bracket (c). Normally the stave is labelled recording/electronic sounds/sampled sounds, etc. However, where there is continuous use of the same timbre or texture, individual ones may be labelled in the margin, to be clear of the stave (c):

[musical example]

### Stave size

It is usually helpful to have cue-sized staves for pre-recorded or live-processed material, to distinguish them from the larger staves of acoustic performers. Cue-sized staves also save space in a multiple-stave score. However, staves should be full-size if detailed material would otherwise not be legible, and also where the electronic part is critical to co-ordination — i.e. when conductor or performer must synchronize precisely with it.

In a playing score (e.g. for a solo performer with electronics), assign the electronic part cue-sized staves, so that the performer's line stands out.

## Placing operational instructions

Instructions as to where to activate a sequence, a program change or any other manoeuvre that changes equipment settings are indicated as numerals (numbering is sequential). Usually they are placed above the stave of the individual who triggers them, to be clear of dynamics. Technician-operated instructions go at the bottom of the system.

Frame each type of manoeuvre in a distinctive way so that boxed numerals (e.g. rehearsal figures, sequence numbers and program changes) can be differentiated. Diamond-shaped boxes are a useful and distinctive design (in the Harvey extract, p. 606, they are used for the program changes (see harmonizer part); circles mark CD track numbers, square boxes distinguish rehearsal letters).

### Footpedal operations

Footpedals are frequently used for making changes to equipment settings. When timing is critical, point an arrow towards the stave or align a dotted line at the relevant place to emphasize that a manoeuvre must be precise. The following example illustrates that changes to be triggered by a footpedal may be placed below the stave. This is more intuitive placing than above the stave, as long as instructions can be clear of dynamics:

[musical example]

(See also Program Changes and Continuous controllers, p. 604.)

## Dynamics for electronic sounds

Indicate dynamics for pre-recorded or live-processed sounds so that the technician can balance volume levels and so that another performer has them as a cue. State whether the balance of performer and electronic sounds should be equal, or whether the performers should be in relief.

There are three potential sources of dynamics:

- those pre-recorded into the sound file or programmed into the software
- fader levels to be adjusted by the technician
- performers' dynamics that affect electronic transformation

When performer and technician use the same score, and dynamics emanate from more than one source, clearly distinguish the three roles.

Pre-programmed dynamics: these are required by the performer and also the technician (who needs to monitor levels), but they may be given square brackets, to indicate their descriptive role. (Since there is no established convention for this differentiation, define the significance of the square bracket in a preface.)

Fader levels: dynamics to be adjusted by a technician are best boxed, so as to be conspicuous in the score (see example below). Alternatively, or in addition, include the label 'Fader' before the dynamic. (When levels to be adjusted relate to live processing — e.g. using a harmonizer — and require detailed instructions, assign an individual line, grid or stave for such a process: see Continuous controllers, p. 604.)

Performer's dynamics: allocate ordinary unbracketed dynamics:

[musical example]

If all dynamics are to be implemented by the technician, a performance note at the outset is sufficient instruction.

## Co-ordination with pre-recorded material (fixed media)

Some pieces may be barred metrically for the acoustic performer but use graphic or proportional notation to describe the electronic component. Should some co-ordination be required between the two, place barlines through the electronic staves (or grid). This provides orientation for the technician. Thus a score in which the staves for both the acoustic performers and electronics are barred implies a degree of co-ordination between the two.

Barlines may be omitted from an electronic part that does not require synchronization with the performers.

### Music without barlines

Where the performer's part contains no barlines, indicate synchronization points by placing a vertical line between the parts. Where one part is to signal another, add an arrow to a diagonal line in order to draw attention to a cue (see Performer signals, p. 620; see also Harvey extract, p. 606).

When close co-ordination is required, the performer's part must specify this, e.g. by marking it synchronize with electronics. When co-ordination is no longer required, specify the requisite level as independently/synchronize approximately.

### Timings for pre-recorded material

Give frequent timing points above the electronic part, especially surrounding significant events, to facilitate rehearsal. In the example of graphic illustration, p. 595, regular timings of 5" at equidistant intervals across the page make the time-space relationship easy to follow. This particular grid takes barlines to clarify the 5" sections.

For a piece consisting entirely of pre-recorded material, use cumulative timings, as the playback equipment will show these (see Cumulative timings, p. 638).

In a piece requiring co-ordination with an acoustic performer, use cumulative timings only if the performer co-ordinates with the recording by following a stopwatch or equivalent. In the following score, for clarity timings are given above the harpsichord part in boxes, since the player must follow a stopwatch:

[musical example]

Where the performer does not use a stopwatch, indicate individual durations of events, sections or bars (see Harvey extract, p. 606; see also Defining time-limits, p. 636).

## Sampled sounds

An electronic keyboard or other device, such as a footpedal, capable of transmitting MIDI information can trigger sampled sounds.

### Trigger keyboard

When a keyboard is used to trigger sampled sounds, notate the keys that the performer is to play, even though the sounds produced may have different pitches or no clear pitch at all. For reference it is often helpful, where practical, to indicate in the preface to a score the resultant pitches triggered by a given key in a given program and also the timbral nature of the sounds. (This helps to verify whether the files have been loaded correctly into the equipment.) While providing this information in a preface minimizes clutter in the score and instrumental part (if separate), there will be times when other performers need actual pitches of sampled notes to be given for balance or tuning purposes, or as cues.

### Samples as cues

Where a performer must balance, tune to or co-ordinate with sampled pitches that do not sound as written, indicate the resultant sounds in the score. A brief verbal description of sounds is useful:

[musical example]

Differentiate actual sounds, e.g. frame them in square brackets; label them actual sounds/sounding:

[musical example]

A cue stave is usually placed above the MIDI part (below a left-hand keyboard stave if necessary):

[musical example]

When the performer who triggers the samples has an individual part separate from the full score, it is necessary only to include either the played keys or else numbered footpedal trigger indications (see Footpedal operations, p. 598). Cues of sampled sounds provided in instrumental parts require only the actual sounds.

## MIDI sequence

A MIDI sequence (an automated series of synthesised or sampled notes) is triggered by either a performer (e.g. with a footpedal) or a technician seated at a computer. An instruction to activate a sequence may require only a framed indication of starting point. Align it precisely where it should start — divide rests if necessary (see penultimate bar):

[musical example]

A horizontal band or wavy continuation line on an individual line or stave may be used to indicate the length of a sequence, if helpful (see example opposite).

### MIDI sequence as cues

A cue stave showing the resultant sequence (or a section of it) can be very helpful for balance, co-ordination and tuning, and as a cue.

If the conductor or performer needs only to follow on at the end or at a particular point in the sequence, indicate only as much of the sequence as is necessary for a secure entry. Normally it is best to place the cue stave directly above the stave of the performer who has triggered it (i.e. in normal cue position), so that the conductor can see its correlation to the trigger note. In the following example, the violinist triggers the sequences with a footpedal:

[musical example]

## Delay lines

Using digital delay procedures (formerly, tape delay) may involve scoring the delay lines to facilitate precise co-ordination and to show the harmony. Ideally, provide a full score for rehearsal and study purposes, and a separate part for the performer if page turns are otherwise impractical.

In some works it may be possible to simplify the notation of delay lines as long as essential information is present for co-ordination. In the first section of the playing score of Harvey's Ricercare Una Melodia for trumpet and tape-delay system, entries important for co-ordination are given but tied notes and some figuration omitted so as not to overload the performer with information; the four playback lines are compressed onto two staves to allow for convenient page-turns.

Notate the delay lines on cue-sized staves below the performers staves. Where such scoring would be very complex, it may be sufficient to indicate where input (recording) and output (playback) occur. Indicate on the score:

- where to start and stop the recording, and input levels
- where to start and stop the playback, and output levels
- feedback levels (if employed)

Where processing parameters (e.g. filter frequency or reverberation time) change rapidly and have to be precisely synchronized with the acoustic performers, continuous information may be essential. Allocate each process an individual line, grid or stave. In Time and Motion Study II for cello and live electronics, Ferneyhough uses a continuous line to represent the control of each delay line, rather than notating the resultant sound (which would provide too much complex information to be practical). A band of vertical shading above the line indicates recording level, a band of diagonal shading below the line indicates playback level, and a separate thick black line represents feedback level.

## Program Changes

Numerals representing configurations of software settings — program changes or patch numbers — should be clearly indicated at the point at which they occur.

In a performance score or separate instrumental part, it is helpful for rehearsal purposes to place program changes or patch numbers at the end of the previous passage and at the start of a new passage. It is also useful to add them at the top of each page.

A brief verbal description of the content of the program may be useful so that the performer knows what to expect, and so the technician can check the correct program is operating. However, keep description minimal so as not to clutter the music:

[musical example]

(The flute example, p. 598, also shows footpedal program changes with short verbal description.)

## Continuous controllers

Instructions regarding controllers which vary parameters continuously — as opposed to switches which trigger events — (e.g. a modulation wheel or volume pedal) should be placed below the relevant performer's line. In a keyboard part, place instructions for a manual controller above or below the system according to the hand that manoeuvres the device (this may depend on the equipment model).

Technician-operated manoeuvres should appear at the bottom of the score. They may be indicated without an individual stave, especially if instructions are intermittent. In Saariaho's Lichtbogen, the following modified dynamic symbols provide clear, efficient notation for the manoeuvres of both the harmonizer (transposing input sound to harmonize with the original) and the reverberation controls. The numerals indicate the percentage of the levels to be used (the lowest level = zero):

[musical example]

Alternatively, where levels need to show simply minimum and maximum settings, they may be indicated with a continuous band on a single line or between a grid of two lines (as below). A continuous band on the time-space axis indicates the position of levels at a glance: this is especially helpful when starting in the middle of a section in rehearsal. (The line or grid may be omitted from score systems in passages in which levels are 'zero'.)

[musical example]

For finer distinctions, the depth of a stave may define a percentage or numerical value in line with the calibration of the equipment used. In the case of a pitch bend wheel, the middle line represents 'zero' (i.e. no transposition). At the outset of the program, either state the interval that each stave-space represents (in the following case, a semitone), or specify the intervals (+2 and -2 semitones in the example below) between the middle line ('zero') and the top (maximum) and bottom (minimum) lines (the intervals could potentially change in different programs):

[musical example]

Where another performer requires pitches produced by a harmonizer as a cue, it is helpful to notate the resultant sounds in addition to the numerals that represent these pitches in semitones (in the harmonizer part, p. 606, -6 = down a tritone, +5 = up a perfect fourth). The resultant pitches also enable the technician to check that the settings are correct; in addition he or she can then adjust volume levels to ensure that the notated pitches sound. Since a stave is already required for the harmonizer's resultant sounds, it can simultaneously illustrate volume control: minimum at the bottom of the stave to maximum at the top (see following example).

In Harvey's Advaya, the different technical procedures are set out on individual staves. This clarifies the separate operations effectively:
