# 20. Freedom and Choice

## Rhythmic independence and synchronization

### Barlines and time signatures

Barlines serve a very practical purpose: music without barlines is difficult to count. Where music is of a rhythmic nature it is always better to have barlines. Barlines function to delineate manageable units of music that the performer can (generally) assimilate at a glance. Where there is to be no metrical stress, barlines may be used for orientation only, though such use should be explained in a preface (see Introduction, p. 151). Omit barlines only where they obscure the musical sense (see Suitable contexts, p. 629).

In ensemble music, barlines are essential for precise rhythmic co-ordination.

For practicality, time signatures should always be used in conducted music, even if this means that every bar requires a different time signature.

#### Music without time signatures

In unconducted music with irregular bar lengths, it is acceptable to omit time signatures that would otherwise be cumbersome to qualify, i.e. where bars are made up of groups of complex stresses:

[musical example]

In music without time signatures, rest bars in instrumental parts will require indication of all durations — either as a rhythm cue or else rests divided up to show true bar lengths — i.e. not single whole-bar rests (see Alternative notation: rests tailored to the metre, p. 160).

### Cadenzas and solo ad libitum passages

Material of a soloistic nature to be performed free of metrical constraint, i.e. ad libitum ('at will'), may be notated in one of several ways, according to the nature of the music:

- it may be barred metrically
- dotted barlines may demarcate sections of regular or irregular length
- it may be notated without barlines

Whichever treatment a passage takes, it should state its tempo relationship to the previous bars (see note-value equivalents, example below, bars 1-2).

#### Accompanying parts

Instrumental parts of accompanying instruments should include an indication that they must take their lead from the solo part. This may be marked as cadenza or colla parte, or, if appropriate, colla voce (Italian, 'with the voice').

Where each accompanying part consists of either a single sustained note (or chord) or rests, treat each as a single bar for the duration of the free section. (Thus these parts remain unaffected by any independent barring in the solo part's material.) Assign each part a pause bar with appropriate durations to make up the notional metrical value of the bar. For convenience, the metrical value of the bar may match that of the previous metre. It is equally acceptable for accompanying parts to be treated as if they were in 4/4 bars (see Accompanying parts, p. 611).

Where a passage spans more than one system in a score, it is helpful to restate the note-values of accompanying parts on successive systems as tied notes. Rests may also be restated. Place these restated notes and rests in brackets to indicate that in an instrumental part a single note or rest will represent them:

[musical example]

The end of a metrically free section is signalled by a tempo (or else by a new tempo indication). No new time signature is required, unless there is a change from a previous metre.

(For recommended use of accidentals regarding all music without barlines, see Music without barlines and ad libitum passages, p. 87.)

### Unmeasured bars (Music without metre)

A bar or section without metre functions to allow the individual musician a degree of metrical freedom. Its roots are in dramatic recitative, where metre is subservient to the dramatic delivery of the music. Such a bar or section is labelled senza misura (Italian, 'without metre'). Terms such as ad lib./recitativo/freely/tempo libero may also be used.

An 'X' placed on the stave cancels an existing time signature. Indicate whether the performer takes a new speed (see example below, bar 2) or continues at the same speed as the previous metre — l'istesso tempo (as in bar 4). Note that it is helpful to make an individual's tempo changes typographically different from markings that affect the whole ensemble. In the example below they are given in italic; in later examples (see Score sample 1 ff., p. 614) individual tempi have a reduced-sized conventional roman bold typeface.

[musical example]

#### Accompanying parts

Parts that have rests or a sustained-note accompaniment may take a convenient duration, e.g. durations equivalent to a 2/4 or an 4/4 bar (the example above treats the senza misura bars as if they were in 4/4 — see bar 2 and 4; see also extract from Britten's Paul Bunyan, p. 622). These rests or notes do not necessarily need to take pauses, but they should do so if it is useful to convey a sense of extended duration.

A stemless note may also indicate a note of unmeasured duration (see Placing material freely within a defined time-span, p. 628).

#### Barlines

It is helpful visually to separate free and metred bars with thin double barlines.

Individual lines within a free passage may take dotted barlines to indicate independent stresses — i.e. in the same way that cadenza and ad libitum material does (see oboe part in Score sample 1, p. 614). It is useful to reserve solid barlines for co-ordination points (see Section without metre, p. 617).

#### Moving on into a metre

At the end of a senza misura section, it is clearest to restate a time signature for a subsequent metred bar (bar 3), even where the time signature is the same as the previous metred passage (bar 1). Where the previous tempo is reinstated, confirm this with a tempo/in tempo/misurato ('measured') and/or with a restatement of a metronome marking (if applicable).

When a performer must wait for a co-ordination signal at the end of a senza misura section, insert a pause over the final duration that precedes the signal (end of bar 4):

[musical example]

In place of a pause, Britten's Curlew sign ⌣ is a useful device for indicating that the duration under the sign may be longer or shorter than the written one, according to when the signal comes:

[musical example]

## Independent parts within an ensemble

Performers who are to be rhythmically independent of one another should be marked independently or own tempo. These terms make a clearer distinction than ad lib. or freely, which might seem to refer to an ensemble rubato (unless qualified in a preliminary note — as is the case in the Lutoslawski extract below).

Where more than one member of an ensemble is independent, state whether they perform independently of each other or co-ordinate as a group (see Synchronized group, p. 615).

In some scores, a frame is placed around a part in independent tempo to draw attention to it. This isolating device is a visual reminder that there is no fixed rhythmic alignment with the ensemble (see, for instance, Birtwistle's Verses for Ensembles). However, in some circumstances a frame might be a visual distraction (the examples in this chapter reserve a frame for certain performance choices — see Placing material freely within a defined time span, p. 628, and Alternatives (Choices), p. 643).

### Alignment as if parts are in strict time

When musicians are performing at approximately the same speed, rhythmically align the parts in a score even though the rhythmic values are approximate and the sequence of notes may not precisely coincide as shown.

In the following extract the players have only a co-ordinated starting point: a downbeat from the conductor at fig. 31. Thereafter they play independently (a footnote at the initial ad libitum section indicates this):

[musical example]

(See also Conductor signals, p. 617.)

### Alignment according to likely ensemble

When the tempi between parts are markedly different, it is helpful to align parts vertically relative to their different speeds, including when tempo differences are placed in the independent parts to ensure that they cannot be performed together (e.g. individual accelerando or rallentando markings).

Where a score has some independent lines, align them according to their likely ensemble with the metred parts (see oboe and bassoon parts, below).

Omit barlines through the stave of an independent part. Where it rejoins the rest of the ensemble, joined barlines indicate this visually:

[musical example]

(See also Parts in different tempi (Poly-tempo), p. 177.)

#### Cues in instrumental parts

In a work without conductor, where an independent part must rejoin a metred ensemble, provide a simultaneous cue of ensemble material. The function of the cue is to indicate the precise length of the passage against which the player must place the independent line. Thus the player can rejoin the ensemble where indicated:

[musical example]

In an extended senza misura section, a written cue may be necessary only immediately before the player rejoins the ensemble, since, in practice, a cue must be largely ignored by a player concentrating on his or her own line.

(See also Cue stave, p. 575.)

### Sections with free alignment

Works or sections that are intended not to be precisely co-ordinated (e.g. in which each part has a different speed) may exist without being in score form at all. Instead the score is a document of the contents of each part, each part being laid out on separate pages, or in separate sections on the same page. (Lutoslawski organized sections of his String Quartet score in this latter way, so that the players could not deliberately — mistakenly — co-ordinate free sections. The players are independent, although they play in approximately the same tempo.) Alternatively, such works may exist as a set of parts alone without a score.

### Synchronized group

When two or more individuals are to perform together independently of the rest of an ensemble, give an explicit instruction to indicate where they are to do so, which performer leads (if relevant), and with whom each co-ordinates (Italian: 'col...') (see Indication of prominent entries, p. 567).

In a score, join barlines for players (but not voices) on adjacent staves who synchronize, if these staves would normally have joined barlines:

[musical example]

(Some of the examples in this section are set out as rhythmic outlines. Numerals are added to indicate the number of players intended.)

(See also Synchronized repeats, p. 626.)

#### Cues in instrumental parts

Where one part is to synchronize with another, provide a simultaneous cue of the other line. A rhythm cue is usually sufficient, although a pitch cue may be added to material lacking sufficient rhythmic definition. If necessary, place vertical lines between the cue and the playing part to clarify synchronization (see Player 3's part extracted from Table 1 (c), p. 618).

## Indicating synchronization (Unmeasured bars and independent ensemble)

### Parts in different tempi

It is important to show where parts should synchronize. When barlines coincide between parts, bar parts together if they would normally be joined in a score. To show rhythmic alignment elsewhere, add a vertical line between the noteheads on the different staves. Where there are few synchronization points, a line may show each instance of the coinciding parts; where one part joins the tempo of another and the two continue together, a single line at the initial co-ordination point may be sufficient, and not overload the score (see following example). A vertical dotted line creates a contrast with ordinary barlines; it should not intersect intervening staves.

The following example illustrates how a performer picks up a tempo established by another musician (the extremely rapid tempo changes have been created purely for the purposes of illustrating rhythmic alignment in a short example). Verbal instructions clarify how the performers synchronize:

[musical example]

#### Cues in instrumental parts

To co-ordinate music in different tempi, it is very likely that the performers will need to read from a playing score so as to see how their parts relate to the others. Where this is inappropriate or impractical, add a cue stave to each part. This may contain another line in the same tempo (so that the players can keep together). Where more appropriate, the cue may be a line in a different tempo against which the player must measure his or her own part.

### Section without metre

Since an ordinary barline indicates that a conductor gives a downbeat, use a barline where the whole (or the majority) of an ensemble is to synchronize in a section without metre. In consequence such a section can be referenced by bar number or rehearsal mark (and requires no further signals to be marked).

A traditional approach to marking co-ordination points (a signal from the conductor, or from one performer to another) is to use dotted barlines. The duration of sections between dotted barlines does not necessarily represent equal duration — an instruction at the outset can state whether or not the durations are entirely free. The dotted barlines should be placed only through the staves of players who need the cues, or who count the cues before their entries: see Table 1 (a), p. 619.

This approach is particularly suited to pieces in which all performers use the same source (e.g. the full score of a small chamber work, or a vocal score of a choral work). Where a section without metre requires several consecutive signals, it is helpful to label these individually (see below).

### Conductor signals

An alternative to using dotted barlines is to indicate visually where the conductor gives signals.

A work may feature two types of conductor signal: a main signal for all or several performers, to indicate the start of an unmeasured or independent section; and a subsidiary signal for a few or individual performers. These two types may be distinguished in one of two ways.

One approach is to use different styles of rehearsal marks. Use an ordinary rehearsal mark for each main signal. Number subsidiary signals separately, so that they can be omitted from most parts (see Conductor signals in instrumental parts, p. 618). Label the main signal also as the first subsidiary signal, to avoid confusion when counting. Place signal numerals at the top of the system to be clearly visible (not merely above the stave to be signalled): see Table 1 (b) and (c), p. 619.

The other approach is to use two styles of arrow, e.g.:

Main signal      ↓
Subsidiary signal ➔

Where barlines represent main signals, it is necessary to indicate only subsidiary signals with arrows (see Table 1 (b), opposite). Place the arrows at the top of the system.

For absolute clarity, both styles may be combined by attaching arrows below the rehearsal marks (as in (b) opposite; see also Lutoslawski extract, p. 613).

To make it very clear which performer requires a signal, add a vertical line down the score (omitting intervening staves) as far as the relevant stave. Use a solid or dotted line, choosing whichever is most appropriate (a solid line will be very conspicuous — potentially distracting in some contexts).

Vertical lines between notes in the score indicate simultaneous entries. This shift of emphasis away from the dotted barline (as in (a)) to marking out visually simultaneous events (as in (b) and (c)) can make simultaneous events look more immediate. Where there are many co-ordination points, this may be helpful for the score reader (see Table 1, opposite).

Adding arrowheads to the vertical lines, pointing to the entries to be signalled, makes them conspicuous in a large score (see, for instance, Birtwistle, Down by the Greenwood Side).

In a score of large forces with many staves, vertical lines may be distracting and therefore impractical. Boulez's Rituel: in memoriam Bruno Maderna offers a more practical solution: numbered conductor signals with a short arrow are placed at the top of the system (in the manner of (b), opposite) and are repeated above the stave to be signalled.

#### Conductor signals in instrumental parts

Conductor signals that are marked in a score should be inserted into individual instrumental parts. Subsidiary signals may be omitted for a part that is tacet between main signals (or barlines). (In Table 1, opposite, player 5 requires only a single whole-bar rest between rehearsal letters A and B.) Players entering between main signals (or barlines) should have all subsidiary signals marked into their parts, so that they do not to enter (or finish) early. It is helpful to specify the other performers who must be signalled prior to an entry, for the same reason (bar 1, signals 2 and 3):

[musical example]

Note that marking conductor signals may be sufficient cue without additional pitch or rhythm cues.

### Performer signals

Place a diagonal line between staves to indicate a signal from one performer to another, or to and from a cue of electronic sounds. It is helpful to attach an arrow to the diagonal line, pointing towards the stave of the performer to be signalled.

Where synchronization points need to be indicated as well, use vertical lines: a vertical line always indicates simultaneous events. Use contrasting designs of vertical and diagonal lines: either have solid lines for signals and dotted lines for synchronization (as below), or vice versa.

[musical example]

(The cello part is shown opposite.)

#### Performer signals in instrumental parts

It is essential to indicate where one performer is giving a signal to another, as well as to indicate where to follow a signal. Note the following guidelines:

- Where one performer signals another, an arrow points away from this stave
- Where a performer receives a signal, an arrow points towards this stave
- Where a player must co-ordinate with a succession of entries, each entry must be written in as a cue

The following example highlights the comprehensive cueing that may be required to synchronize parts in unmeasured bars of unconducted music. The more cue information provided, the more precise the co-ordination can be:

[musical example]

(Lutoslawski's String Quartet is a good example to follow: thorough cueing and verbal instructions indicate where the parts must co-ordinate, where each player gives a signal or waits for a signal. There are no cues or signals where the instrumentalists play their own parts independently and must ignore the others.)

## Independent repetition

Independent repetition should be notated in a different way from conventional repeats. Material of a whole beat, whole bar or two-bars' length in which rhythms are to be repeated in strict time and in the prevailing metre should be notated either in full or using the Z repeat-bar sign. Setting out each bar in this way shows that repeats are to be performed conventionally, and are not to be rhythmically independent in any way (see Repeat-beat and repeat-bar abbreviation, p. 230; for instrumental parts, see Repeated bars, p. 578).

Individual figures of regular, fast notes to be repeated freely may be written as beamed groups (open-ended groups convey a sense of continuity) and followed by a wavy (trill) line for the required duration. Place the wavy line after the pitches, either on the middle stave line (mid-system for a double-stemmed group) or at the level of the pitches — whichever position is most conspicuous. Add an instruction such as repeat ad lib above the wavy line at its first appearance:

[musical example]

### Independent-repetition signs

Repeat barlines may be used where individual parts repeat at their own speed. Suitable circumstances are:

- repetition with an individual tempo
- free repetition within a given tempo, or with individual tempo changes (e.g. accelerandi and rallentandi) so as deliberately to be independent of other performers
- extending material for an unspecified duration, according to the requirements of a dramatic situation (this is the origin of this device):

[musical example]

(Violin lines amalgamated for practical purposes.)

A verbal instruction should clarify the manner of repetition, for instance, either repeat in strict time, or repeat independently (see Instructions for repetition, p. 624).

Passages of individual repetition may have their own time signatures (see Score layout with independent repetition, p. 626) If a repeat of material with an individual time signature is to be in strict time, creating a cross rhythm, it should be notated to show its relationship with the other parts (see Repetition in independent metre or tempo, p. 577).

### Design

Material to be repeated should be enclosed with repeat barlines (a) or brackets ((b) — (d)). Curved end notches differentiate independent-repetition signs from ordinary repeats and make them more conspicuous ((b) — (d)). Where it is important to show that repeats do not coincide with metrical barlines, use a single bracket design, as it is then easier to see the position of ordinary barlines ((c) and (d)). (The dotted brackets in the Britten extract opposite are even more helpful for this purpose.)

[musical example]

The repeat barlines or brackets are followed by a continuation line centred on the middle stave-line. The continuation line often functions to indicate that the number of repeats is not predetermined.

Although a wavy line is most commonly used, a second design consisting of a straight line may be used as well and the two designs assigned different performance instructions (see Moving on after repetition, p. 625). A trill line may be used to create a wavy line, and a straight line should be of beam thickness, so as to be conspicuous on the stave.

An arrow at the end of the continuation line is useful to indicate where repetition carries onto a following system; an end notch is helpful to clarify the cut-off point of a straight line:

[musical example]

In a braced part, the repeat barlines or brackets join the staves together. Centre the continuation line mid-system:

[musical example]

(For use of the octave extension line with independent repetition, see Length of the extension line, p. 30.)

### Instructions for repetition

Place instructions above each continuation line initially, to specify:

- whether the individuals of an instrumental section (e.g. 1st Violins) or Choir voice part starts the repetition together, or independently
- whether material is to be repeated independently of the conductor or the ensemble, or together with other (specified) performers
- whether material is to be repeated in the prevailing tempo or at a different tempo or should vary in speed
- whether sections (or bars) of the repetition should be performed with progressively longer, shorter or variable-length breaks in between

#### Duration of repetition
An instruction to perform material a given number of times is best written as play (or sing) four times, and not x 3 or repeat 3 times. The latter is confusing since the performer counts the first statement as '1':

[musical example]

(See also Multiple-repeat sections, p. 579.)

To repeat material for a given duration, indicate the timing above the independent-repetition section, making sure that the extension line is included in the timing (a). If duration is given only for the repetition, wording must clarify that the duration does not include the initial statement (b):

[musical example]

Where a signal from another musician determines the length of repetition, duration may be less significant information — although it is often helpful to give an approximation (unless it is too variable to be of any use). To repeat until a signal, give an explicit instruction such as 'repeat until signal from . . ., then stop/move on'. It is helpful to place an arrow where the signal is given and to label the musician who gives it (see following example (a)). A rehearsal mark or signal numeral indicates a conductor's signal. Vertical dotted lines may replace arrowed signals to show exactly where the cue comes — useful if rehearsal marks are some distance above the stave (b):

[musical example]

To move on from one repeat to another without a break, join the continuation line to the following repeat barline or bracket:

[musical example]

#### Moving on after repetition

In both score and part, give an instruction as to how the performer will move on from the repetition. Place this information in a preface, a footnote or immediately above the stave. Two commonly used options are as follows. One option is:

At the signal, move on/stop immediately without completing the repeated material.

The continuation line should stop precisely at the signal or barline. The signal in this example is that given for the 3/4 bar by the conductor (or leader in an unconducted piece):

[musical example]

The other option is:

At the signal, move on/stop after completing the whole repeat/a section of the repeat up to a dotted/solid barline.

To reflect the instruction, the continuation line should run slightly after the signal or barline:

[musical example]

Where a piece requires more than one option, use different designs of continuation line, to save repeating instructions. The distinct uses in the examples on p. 625 reflect, for instance, the definitions usually assigned to them in the scores of Lutoslawski:

at the signal, finish the repeat section and then go on/stop
at the signal, go on immediately/stop immediately

### Score layout with independent repetition

Material to be repeated in the same tempo as other parts (either with metred parts or those with independent repetition) should align rhythmically with them, whether or not ensemble is to be precisely synchronized. Allow extra space in the alignment of metred parts for the repeat barlines or brackets in other parts and, if used, individual time signatures within the repeated sections:

[musical example]

Each performer with independent repetition takes separate barlines. This is in contrast to cases in which performers synchronize repeats (see below).

Where individual repetitions have markedly different tempi, place notes according to their likely ensemble with other parts (see following example). (This notation follows the same principle as aligning independent parts in a score — see Alignment according to likely ensemble, p. 614.)

Where a passage of individual repetition has its own time signature, place this inside the repeated section. A time signature that applies to the whole ensemble goes before the repeat barlines. Include it even where it is not relevant to the independent repetition (see placing of 4/4 for players 2 and 3 in the example opposite), since it should be transferred to an instrumental part: a player must know that a change of time signature occurs at this point.

#### Synchronized repeats

Where performers with independent repetition are to synchronize amongst themselves, vertically align their parts in the score. Extend the repeat barlines or brackets to the staves of adjacent performers who are to synchronize and use a single pair of repeat dots and a single continuation line. (Keep the barlines or brackets of braced parts separate, for the sake of clarity.)

State with whom each performer co-ordinates, which performer leads (if relevant), and that they play together, independently of the ensemble:

[musical example]

(This is the same alignment principle as where two or more performers with independent rhythms synchronize — see Synchronized group, p. 615.)

#### Cues in instrumental parts

A player who is to rejoin an ensemble may require a cue immediately beforehand (as at rehearsal letter 5, below). In unconducted music, it may be necessary to cue another part for the entire length of the player's repetition so that he or she can measure its duration. Cueing principles are the same as when a player without metre rejoins a metred ensemble (see Cues in instrumental parts, p. 614).

[musical example]

The nature of independent repetition is that the performer must ignore the prevailing metre in order to establish a different one. Therefore, where the player can rely on a signal to start or finish, it may be sufficient to indicate this alone (see example Cues from other performers, p. 625)

##### Cueing the metred ensemble's barlines
Where some or the rest of the ensemble is metred, it may be useful to indicate where the ensemble barlines occur, to show the duration of the passage. Where it is not confusing to do so, include the ensemble's barlines on the player's stave: for this to be practicable, the repetition section must be shorter than, or the same length as, an ensemble bar. It is essential to indicate whether the repeat barlines or brackets coincide with the ensemble barlines or not. (In the example below the closing repeat bracket is placed just within the confines of the ordinary barline so that both can be shown.) Place bar numbers above each ensemble bar to clarify the barring, if necessary.

Where the ensemble's barlines are shown on the same stave, do not give the independent repetition solid barlines as well: use dotted barlines if necessary.

Where the performer must move on after a specified portion of a metred bar, define the duration of the continuation line in relation to the metre. Place a note-value above the stave — but not a rest (see bar 36):

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

Where the independent-repetition section is longer than an ensemble bar, it is too confusing to indicate ensemble barlines on the same stave. Instead, assign a cue line or stave to show the barlines. (The layout is the same as in Repetition in independent metre or tempo — see p. 577.)

Where specified elements within repetition — a range of pitches, rhythms, dynamics and/or performance styles — are to be freely ordered, distinguish this style of repetition by using heavy frames or boxes for such elements (see Alternatives (Choices), p. 643).

### Placing material freely within a defined time-span

It is simplest to write notes of free duration as stemless black notes (but see also Notation options, p. 631).

There are three layout options in metred music. If the time-span is a single bar, then the barline alone can define this duration. An instruction above the stave may clarify this (a). For other than a single bar, define the time-span by centring a frame or heavy square bracket on the stave. Expand the frame's dimensions to reflect the time-span (b) (the first example on p. 644 uses square brackets instead). Alternatively, place a bracket above the stave ((c) and (d)). Should the time-span need to be clarified, indicate note-values above the stave ((b) and (c)). In a senza misura bar, define duration in seconds (d):

[musical example]

* place notes freely within time-span

If pitches may be played in any order, a further instruction is required (see Alternatives (Choices): Layout principles, p. 644).

## Proportional spacing (Time-space notation)

The principle of proportional spacing is that a given measurement on the horizontal axis represents a particular time-span. Notes are placed on this axis according to where they should sound within the defined duration (this is usually given in seconds: see Defining time-units, p. 636). Proportional spacing indicates time intervals without relation to pulse, since it has no reference to metre or conventional note-values.

### Suitable contexts

Where rhythmic precision is unnecessary or inappropriate, proportional spacing can indicate greater rhythmic flexibility than might otherwise be possible. It can convey a rhythmic simplicity that may be obscured by complex notation if expressed within a metrical time-frame. It is ideal notation for indicating a graduated accelerando and ritardando. In such conditions it can be simpler to read and to notate than complex metrical patterns.

Proportional spacing is often suitable for the notation of electronic sounds (see Proportional spacing, p. 594). However, for performance purposes, there are some practical disadvantages. Firstly, isolated notes that are not grouped into conventional beamed units (normally, beats) are very hard to read. Likewise, the absence of barlines is unhelpful since barlines delineate manageable portions of music to read at a glance. Secondly, it is harder to sense a measurement of time by reading distances on a page than it is to count a conventional pulse. Furthermore, the focus on pitch may encourage the performer to produce a 'notey' rather than a 'fluent' response. (In some contexts conventional notation with rubato instructions may elicit a more musically phrased response with the required rhythmic flexibility.)

### Spacing durations

Black noteheads spaced in proportion to each other on the time-space axis replace conventional symbols for duration — note-values, ties and rests. As can be seen from the following example, the less cluttered appearance of the music does not necessarily make it easier to read:

[musical example]

The fastest notes dictate the minimum measurement a time-unit requires. These fast notes must not only fit into the required measurement, or a proportion of it, but must be spaced equally if they are to be performed evenly (consideration should be given to the fact that any symbols preceding a note — e.g. accidentals — will force notes apart). Proportional spacing cannot automatically be condensed for practical purposes, as in conventional metric notation — where one duration need be only marginally longer or shorter than surrounding notes to signify different duration. Thus it may be uneconomical of space, in turn causing page-turn problems. To this end, conventional grace-note groups — to indicate playing a group as fast as possible — may be retained, since they occupy less space than a full-size note (see Table 2, opposite). (For other practical solutions, see Variable time-space proportion, p. 638.)

For recommended use of accidentals, see Music without barlines and ad libitum passages, p. 87.

### Notation options

#### Stemless notes

A stemless notehead placed on the time-space axis is held (on a sustaining instrument or voice) or, otherwise, allowed to decay until the next note, barline or other marker, signal, or comma (to represent a rest) — according to the prescribed performance instruction.

Slurs indicate legato performance, as in conventional notation. Very short notes can be indicated with staccato marks (a):

Table 2: Proportional spacing notation options

[musical example]

An open tie may indicate that a note is to ring on (laissez vibrer), e.g. after the next notes are sounded (see Electronic Interlude, p. 594). This notation does not otherwise have the capacity to indicate continuing sound (see Laissez vibrer, p. 72).

Stemless notes are efficient notation if the priority is to show the point of attack (the options with extended beams ((b) and (c) above) are required for indicating duration visually). Thus stemless notes are appropriate for notating struck and plucked sounds (e.g. piano, percussion and guitar). They are also useful for notating sounds written as a cue, where indicating the entries is important but notating the duration of sustained sounds might clutter a cue with too much information (see Electronic Interlude, p. 594).

#### Options to show sustained sounds

To indicate simultaneous sustained notes of different lengths, and to show the proportion of rest in relation to sustained sound, extend beams from notes in one of the following ways. Blank space between beams represents the proportion of rest. Either of the notation styles below may be used — the context and style of the music dictates which is more appropriate.

##### Extenders at notehead level
A horizontal line of beam thickness (or slightly thinner, if more practical) follows each note. The line may be placed immediately after the notehead, or may emanate directly from it: see example below; also, Table 2 (b), p. 631.

Use a phrase mark to show legato, since an extender must stop short of a subsequent note in close intervallic proximity — earlier if that note has an accidental. A conventional slur shows the length of a phrase at a glance, although a short slur between the end of an extender and the following note may be used so as not to create too many layers of long lines:

[musical example]

The extenders convey the requirement to sustain a sound. This is useful, for instance to show where keys are to be held manually, such as on an organ or electronic keyboard. This immediacy also makes the notation well suited to glissandos and to the notation of chords comprising notes of different duration:

[musical example]

However, in chordal writing, this notation should probably be used only where it is a priority to illustrate the duration of sustained notes, since the extenders add a dense layer of lines to the stave, potentially obscuring both stave lines and subsequent pitches (see Options for close-position intervals, p. 633).

##### Stemmed extended beams

The beam of a stemmed note (or chord) extends horizontally to indicate duration. (The beam is usually without slope so as not to distract the eye from the horizontal.) Consecutive notes join to the same beam to indicate a legato. Short notes may have short diagonal beams (simplified quaver tails) if horizontal beams would otherwise be too short to read clearly. Stems join the notes of chords in a conventional way (see Comparative example of sustained-note notation, below); individual stems and beams show overlapping durations where necessary (see Part-writing, p. 634).

This style looks more conventional than extenders at notehead level and the stave is less cluttered; therefore it is easier to assimilate. In addition, beamed groups convey a sense of rhythmic fluency — partly because they are much easier to read than isolated notes: see Table 2 (c), p. 631.

However, a string of quaver-like notes may look very similar to a line of even quavers, and so there is a danger that the notes will be interpreted in this way (Berio re-notated Sequenza I in conventional note-values so that the player would be forced to play the notated irregular durations.)

##### Options for close-position intervals
Stemmed beams are often the best notation for close-position chords and also for sustained durations that overlap. The following comparative example illustrates why this is so:

Positioning extenders at notehead level requires special treatment so that they do not run into one another. They may be made thinner or moved further apart (if practical), or a bracket may be placed after the notes with an extender attached to it (a); beams for sustained parts must be divided for subsequent pitch entries, so as not to obscure them — this compromise is not very satisfactory, as it suggests a break in sound (b):

Comparative example of sustained-note notation
[musical example]

##### Over a system break

Notes may be reiterated in brackets as a reminder. Place extenders before each note on the new system to indicate continuity:

[musical example]

##### Part-writing
Stemmed beams have the capacity to show two (or more) parts on a single stave as well as multiple overlapping parts. Where it is unnecessary to show part-writing, it may be simpler to use extenders at notehead level.

For both styles of notation, indicate whether chords containing adjacent notes should sound simultaneously, since all notes cannot take precise vertical alignment. Place a vertical bracket before a chord to indicate simultaneous sounds:

[musical example]

### Score layout

As in conventional score layout, proportional spacing should follow the principle of vertical alignment of simultaneous sounds. Place proportionally spaced parts in vertical alignment with each other and with any simultaneous metred parts.

In a score that combines both forms of notation, barlines may be omitted through the staves of proportionally spaced parts (see example opposite, letter P). These layout principles are the same as those used for combining ad libitum and metred parts (see Alignment according to likely ensemble, p. 614).

Where barlines are omitted from the score, any extracted instrumental parts should likewise appear without barlines: the parts will require a simultaneous cue of the metred ensemble against which to measure duration (see Cues in instrumental parts, p. 614).

In some cases it is beneficial for corresponding instrumental parts to have metred barlines so that players can pace their parts accordingly (see examples under Within single metred bars, below).

#### Alternating time-space and metric notation

The unconventional look of proportional spacing makes such a section so obviously different in appearance from metred music that it is not always necessary to add further indications. However, a thin double barline or co-ordination signal (if appropriate) is useful for alerting the reader to the start of a section using proportional spacing, as at letter Q, below. Where proportional spacing appears in just one player's part, define the time-span above the individual's stave (bar 1):

[musical example]

Within single metred bars: it is feasible to alternate the two forms of notation if the style differentiates them clearly (the use of barlines continues to indicate duration):

[musical example]

If proportionally spaced durations have stemmed beams, then the different styles may be less apparent, and should be clarified with an explicit instruction:

[musical example]

### Defining time-units

A consistent ratio between horizontal space and duration requires a definition at the outset of the relevant section. A statement of only an initial time-unit may be sufficient. Place this indication above the stave, either as duration in seconds or as a metronome measurement. A verbal definition (such as that given below for the first example) is a useful addition:

1 inch/2.5 cm = 1 second

[musical example]

Indicating solely an initial time-unit (i.e. with no subsequent duration markers) gives the performer a considerable degree of freedom, which might be suitable for a solo piece or in cases in which the musicians are seldom required to synchronize. Where speeds should not be too flexible or where some degree of co-ordination is required, indicate duration markers at regular or irregular intervals. The options are given below.

#### Duration markers

In scores using proportional spacing, barlines may continue to define time-units, provided a given duration is indicated for each bar length. However, a different style of duration marker emphasizes a non-metrical section in an otherwise metred piece.

The measurement of space between two markers defines the time-span: the marker should fall exactly at the beginning of the time-unit. This is a more literal use of the horizontal time-space axis than in conventional notation: a note to be played at the start of a time-unit should coincide with the marker. A symbol that precedes the note (e.g. an accidental) goes before the marker (see Table 3 (a)-(c), opposite).

When choosing the style of the duration marker, consider its function. Where there is a significant degree of freedom, short vertical lines above the stave are the most appropriate option, because they do not interrupt the flow of music on the stave; neither do they coincide with or obscure the note ((a) and (b) opposite). (Short markers placed at the top of the stave are best avoided, as they look too similar to pitches.)

Where markers represent signals from the conductor or another performer, place them close to the stave (not some way above it) or on the stave itself (in which case dotted barlines should be used). Markers must be easy to follow while the performer reads his or her own line. Where vertical space is limited, dotted barlines in the stave (or between the staves of a braced part) will save space ((c) below).

To avoid a collision of notes and dotted barlines (as in (c)), another option is to place notes (together with their preceding symbols, such as accidentals) immediately after dotted barlines. A performance note should state that such notes start at the beginning of the time-unit (Table 3 (d), below).

##### Constant time-space proportion

Each time-span marked on a page should be in proportional length to its duration. The space needed to fit the densest notation into a time-unit determines this measurement (see Spacing durations, p. 630). In the case of evenly spaced markers (representing the same unit throughout), it is necessary only to label the first unit:

TABLE 3: Comparative examples of duration markers

[musical example]

If markers are required less frequently, label sections with individual durations, according to co-ordination requirements (see also Signalled time-units, p. 638):

[musical example]

For players who co-ordinate in an ensemble piece, assign the same time-unit durations in each player's part.

If a consistent time-space proportion causes a significant portion of the music to be unnecessarily widely spaced, consider the following option.

##### Variable time-space proportion

Select individual time-units according to the space each unit requires. Individual units need not relate proportionally to one another (but the spacing within individual units should remain proportional). This variable spacing allows notational density to be evened out on a page, potentially making the music easier to read, and may help to accommodate convenient page-turns:

[musical example]

##### Cumulative timings

Cumulative timings often accompany graphic or proportional notation, particularly where the notation illustrates an electronic part for cueing or information purposes, rather than a set of instructions to be played (see examples under Proportional spacing and Graphic illustration, pp. 594-5). Distinguish cumulative timings by placing them at the end of each time-unit and framing them in a distinctive way (this differentiates them from an actual duration of a single time-unit).

While regular timings at equidistant intervals across the page are often most appropriate, timings at irregular intervals are more useful in circumstances such as to coincide with significant entries. Variable time-space proportion may be used (as described above):

[musical example]

(See Timings for pre-recorded material, p. 600.)

##### Signalled time-units

In both a score and instrumental parts, if it is important for performers to measure their lines against a conductor's beat, include all time-unit divisions that the conductor signals (use an appropriate style from those illustrated above). Use variable time-units if the conductor signals duration in this way. A performance instruction can state that all time-unit markers are signalled (if this is the case).

#### Cues in instrumental parts

Regular time-unit markers (or barlines) may provide sufficient co-ordination points by themselves, so that simultaneous cues of other parts or co-ordination signals are not required.

Where a piece indicates only the initial time-unit, this implies that duration is very flexible. Consequently, in an ensemble piece, synchronization is dependent on the musicians signalling one another. Provide a cue of the performer who leads, or cue a succession of leading entries, so that the player can follow the sequence. Notate only as much of the other lines as is necessary for co-ordination. (In the example below, the 1st Violin part has all other entries cued, as each entry is dependent on the others.) Add a vertical line between the cue stave and the performer's line, if appropriate, to clarify where they should synchronize:

[musical example]

Arrows may clarify how performers signal each other (see Performer signals, p. 620). However, in the above example this would clutter the player's stave, since every entry signals another.

Where a work is highly dependent on players cueing one another, it might be the case that one cue stave cannot contain all lines necessary for co-ordination (e.g. if pitches of different cue lines overlap). Provided there are only a few performers, they may all use a playing score. This will enable them to see how their parts interact at all times (see Playing score, p. 538). However, in many cases a condensed version of selected cues on one cue stave (as above) is likely to be more helpful — i.e. less distracting — in performance.

(See also Cue stave, p. 575.)

### Options to show approximate pitch

#### On the stave

##### Stems without noteheads

The end of the stem where the notehead would normally be placed indicates the approximate position of a pitch. This style of notation is clearest where durations have tails or beams, since it is then obvious which end of the stem represents pitch:

[musical example]

Note that if stems are placed in a uniform position (as if only one pitch were used) this may encourage a monotone delivery (with reference to vocal music, see Spoken text in rhythm, p. 457).

The absence of noteheads may also be used to represent ad libitum pitch choices — a performance note can specify free pitch/vary pitch at will, and so on.

Crotchets, minims and semibreves are cumbersome to write: the end of the stem representing pitch can be identified only by the addition of a tie, duration dot or articulation mark; tied crotchet- or dotted-crotchet values are acceptable, but are not a particularly elegant solution. Therefore, where durations of longer than a quaver predominate, use crossed noteheads instead.

##### Crossed noteheads

Crossed noteheads have the versatility:

- when placed outside or without a stave, to represent various degrees of approximation: they can be placed with or without ledger lines
- to prescribe chords 
- to express longer durations more readily than stems without noteheads
- to prescribe a pitch that should be aimed for but which may not necessarily be technically achievable

Because crossed noteheads always alert the performer to an unusual technique, it is essential to state whether they represent approximate pitch:

[musical example]

When noteheads are placed exclusively on the stave (not outside it), indicate whether or not the stave represents the entire range of the instrument or voice for these purposes (see next section).

Crossed noteheads should have only one definition in a work. Use a contrasting notehead if another meaning, such as an unusual technique, is required (see also Uses, p. 11).

(For vocal music, see also Spoken text in rhythm, p. 457, and Voiced and unvoiced sounds, p. 458.)

#### On a line or grid

Where pitch can be very free or approximate pitch is being described (e.g. in a cue of electronic sounds), replace the five-line stave with one or more lines. This has the practical advantage of enabling ordinary noteheads to be placed on, between or around lines — traditional note shapes are the easiest style to read. Provide a verbal definition of the register that a line or band represents. A single line might represent the middle of the performer's range (a). A band defined by two horizontal lines may represent the outer limits of an instrumental or vocal range (b), or of a particular register (c):

[musical example]

Lines may represent the middle of high, medium or low ranges (a); three bands may represent high, medium and low registers (b):

[musical example]

While extended passages benefit from this notation, it is better to preserve the five-line stave for the occasional approximate-pitch note, chord or figure, and to use stems without noteheads or crossed noteheads instead. This is to avoid potentially confusing changes of range: replacing the stave with one (or more) lines may imply a sudden shift in register. For instance, the middle stave-line of the treble stave redefined as an unspecified pitch in the middle of an instrumental or vocal range might require such a shift.

##### Chords and clusters
A line or grid is efficient notation for approximate-pitch chords or clusters:

[musical example]

(See also Note clusters, p. 326.)

## Alternatives (Choices)

This section deals with how best to present a choice or alternative ordering of any parameter of a piece (tempo, duration, pitch, dynamic, timbre, etc.) to a performer.

### Performance conditions

Choices are appropriate where the composer wishes to involve the performer in the ordering of events or choices of material. They are suitable for situations in which the performers can easily make spontaneous or rehearsed decisions: pieces for solo performer or where generous rehearsal time is available. However, in ensemble music, consider rehearsal and performance conditions carefully before presenting a performer with choices.

Complicated choices or options that require elaborate independent co-ordination, e.g. a sequence of events to be determined by the musicians, may take too much rehearsal time to be practical. Time needed in rehearsal to fathom the meaning of options, or to discuss how they work, detracts from time spent rehearsing the actual music. If the sound of a piece is, on the whole, unlikely to be much different whether all its parameters are fixed (predetermined) or indeterminate (non-predetermined), then a work of entirely fixed order may be the most practical option. Some very experienced composers have rewritten earlier works, turning them from open into through-composed forms, to ensure that they can be rehearsed properly within a practical time frame.

If options are given, include clear instructions and define the boundaries of choice, so that disproportionate rehearsal time is not spent discussing what is intended.

Note that there is a very real danger that a list or sequence giving alternative material, orders of events or of other parameters will be performed in its written order. A contributing factor is that trained musicians are often uncomfortable about making choices, and when under pressure to produce a professional rendition they may choose the safest option. A solution to discourage the performance of material in its written order is to arrange sections on the page so that they do not align horizontally or vertically. This scattered arrangement forces the performer to start in a random place — see, for instance, Stockhausen's Klavierstück XI.

### Layout principles

Enclose the choices or alternative orderings in a heavy frame or box to make them conspicuous and to separate them from other material. If a work requires frames for another purpose (e.g. to indicate placing material freely within a defined time-span — see p. 628), then use different styles of frame: one design should have only one meaning (compare the performance instructions below).

It is essential to give written qualification of performer choices. Where possible, locate instructions immediately above a frame:

[musical example]

### Alternative material

To give one or two alternative routes through a passage, place the alternatives on adjacent staves, one above the other, so that it is equally straightforward to follow any route. (This also enables each option to have vertical alignment with other parts in a score.) Arrows may clarify possible routes through the alternatives. It is useful to frame the options, to remind the musician that he or she does not perform them all. Labelling the options also makes them quicker to identify:

[musical example]

A performance instruction must state performance conditions (see opposite).

(For this style of layout, see also Birtwistle, Verses for Ensembles.)

### Alternative sequences of events

Separate each event with an individual frame. The frames then visually distinguish material that may be performed in an order chosen by the musician, and facilitate jumping from one frame to another in any direction. Alternatively, use one long frame, adding dotted barlines to separate each segment — see Vibraphone example, opposite (this option is unsatisfactory for any extended figures as the options are less clearly separated).

Label the frames or segments so that they can be referenced in a performance note that, for instance, states a permissible order. Labels are also useful so that individual performers reading the same line (e.g. more than one string player or singers of a choral line) can agree the same or an independent order amongst themselves, according to the performance instruction:

[musical example]

According to space constraints, frames can be laid out sequentially (as above) — this would be the most conventional layout in a single-line part — or stacked on separate staves to save horizontal space in a score (see, for instance, Harvey's Come, Holy Ghost).

#### Performance conditions
An explanatory note must indicate how to perform a sequence. The instructions may include the following:

- the sections are to be performed in any order or in one of a number of prescribed orders
- all the sections should be/need not be performed, or only a certain (restricted) number performed
- the sections should or should not be repeated
- a given section should start/finish the sequence
- each performer should start with the same section/with a different section
- an individual should perform the sequence independently of the others or synchronize with them
- the performer should move from one section to the next with/without a break

Give instructions as to how the performer moves on into a following section: whether at a signal he or she either stops immediately (or moves straight on to the following section), or finishes the section before moving on (or stopping).

Tempi, duration and dynamics: if these are relevant to individual renditions of the material, place them inside the frame (see cello and tom-tom examples, below). If they are to apply to the whole passage, place them outside the frames (see clarinet example, opposite).

### Repeating material of unspecified order

Where an order of frames or bars chosen by the performer (a non-predetermined sequence) is to be repeated, either join consecutive frames ((a) below) or place all material in a single frame, separating different segments with dividing lines or barlines (b). Both styles emphasize that the sequence to be repeated includes all the material (not just the last segment) — a performance note should clarify this.

Add a continuation line after the frame (see Independent-repetition signs: Design, p. 623). Using a frame rather than repeat barlines makes the material look different from independent repetition, and thus warns the performer that the sequence is to be other than a straight repeat:

[musical example]

Options may be stacked if this is a more convenient layout — e.g. to facilitate skipping from one long passage to another, or between many options. In this instance, add a single frame or square bracket around all the stacked options (in the manner of the cello example, p. 644). Follow it with a continuation line (this style is used by Birtwistle in Meridian: cf. fig. 46, soprano parts).

It is clearest to read a non-predetermined order of pitches as a succession of single notes rather than a chord, especially for close intervals (see following example).

Where one sequence to be repeated follows on to another without a break in sound, join the continuation line to the following frame:

[musical example]

### Free ordering of lengthy sections

#### Score layout

If the order of sizeable sections of material is not predetermined, it is impractical to show vertical alignment between different parts. Instead the score should become a record of the choices available for individual lines: a page of score is likely to contain groups of framed events grouped separately for each part (laid out in score order of instruments). In the score of Henze's String Quartet No. 4, the music of the fourth movement is set out as a four-page spread for each player in turn (only the opening and closing sections are pre-determined). A performance instruction explains how the movement should be shaped (the 1st Violinist leads, choosing a framed passage, its character and dynamics at will, while the other players follow and echo in similar vein).

#### Instrumental parts

Each player usually requires only the material of his or her own part and instructions (and cues if appropriate) for co-ordination as necessary.

### Defining limits of choice

#### 'Either/or' options

Separate straightforward 'either/or' options with a diagonal stroke inside a single frame:

[musical example]

(See also lower example (b), p. 648.)

'Either/or' options for a series of changing parameters should be stacked in parallel frames. Place these above or below the performer's stave according to the normal position of such performance indications. Place rhythm options above the stave together with those for tempo, duration and timbre:

[musical example]

#### Outer limits of parameters

Define the limits of choice with a two-way arrow (see (a) below). Clarify in a performance note whether the performer chooses from the given options, or chooses an option from within the given parameter, or may fluctuate between the prescribed limits, and, if so, whether in a systematic or random way.

A vertical bracket or note cluster may indicate the extent of pitch options (b):

[musical example]

If material is to be repeated (e.g. as illustrated on p. 646), state how the options should be treated in the repetition, e.g. whether the repetition should use some or all of the given options.

### Optional additional material

Material that may be added to a pre-existing passage should be separated with square brackets. This facilitates omitting it. (In Boulez's Third Piano Sonata, optional additional material is also presented at a smaller size, to emphasize its optional nature.)

[musical example]

### Inserts

Frame material that is to be inserted within a pre-determined passage. State the number of times it should be added. A horizontal line or bracket may indicate the time-span within which it is to be performed:

[musical example]

Where it would otherwise be confusing, place the insert on a separate stave, or as a footnote.
