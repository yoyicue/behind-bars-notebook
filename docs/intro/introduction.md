# Introduction

In an age where computers can do it all for us, what need is there for expertise in, or even a working knowledge of, the principles of notation?

Many will believe that given a certain level of expertise, computer processing enables the user to produce music of the highest quality. Software will make layout and spacing decisions, and produce a beautifully sharp and precise page of music. The innovation of computer technology is indeed essential since most performers today prefer or expect computer-generated material even if some professionals still say that well-spaced hand copying, or a composer's manuscript, tell us more about the music than the impersonality of a computer-set page ever can.

But computer-generated music must satisfy best practices if it is to fulfil its function. I hope that a thorough understanding of the principles set out in this book will complement — indeed complete — the armoury of skills, shortcuts and techniques that the modern musician sitting at a computer has to hand. Computer software can take us so far; only the dexterity and subtlety of the human mind can make the ultimate informed choices notation frequently demands.

## Historical context

The early twenty-first century is an appropriate time to re-establish principles of good practice that have governed notation over the last 150 or so years. New compositional techniques of the mid-twentieth century stimulated notational experiment and innovation, and that left a diverse legacy. Some innovations were indispensable to a specific compositional process but could not be readily transferred to another style. Some, however, have proved adaptable to a range of musical styles and include innovations that may be useful additions to the composer's vocabulary.

The intention of Behind Bars is to encourage the use of established conventions where appropriate since what is familiar is of most help to the musician. The familiar can be read and understood quickly. There are often already so many different ways of notating the same thing that the invention of novel notation to give a score a particular uniqueness is unhelpful and potentially alienating. Unfamiliar notation takes much longer to assimilate; furthermore, the more complicated the notation, the greater the possibility is that it will create a barrier to the reader.

## Using Behind Bars

Within the covers of this book, a clear, detailed hierarchy of headings should enable the reader to navigate the book easily and find information quickly. Related subjects are grouped together where practical; subjects that are treated elsewhere in different contexts are cross-referenced. In general, a topic is structured: definition — design — placing — use.

Every facet of a piece of music, from general layout to the placing of symbols, is very much dependent on individual context. I have illustrated as many contexts as possible within the music examples, and introduce comparative examples to train the eye to distinguish good practice from bad.

The mainstay of Behind Bars is to examine the complex set of rules based on unique or shared conditions. Effective communication results from establishing a convention and adopting a consistent approach. Where appropriate I have presented the rationale for certain conventions and rules, to make such conventions more memorable. Where new technical or compositional demands require new notation, I have proposed conventions that are simple, clear and, where possible, in keeping with traditional practice.
