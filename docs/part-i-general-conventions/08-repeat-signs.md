# 8. Repeat Signs

## TREMOLOS

### Principles of repeated-note abbreviation

A repeated number of notes can be abbreviated provided that the repeated note-value is a quaver or shorter. The repeated notes are usually a tremolo except for quavers or semiquavers in a slow tempo.

Diagonal lines through a stem indicate the note-value of the repetition. These are the tremolo strokes. Each stroke added to the stem doubles the number of repetitions:

[musical example]

Each stroke is, in effect, a shorthand beam. Deduct one stroke for every beam or tail that is added to the stem:

[musical example]

#### Tuplet division (triplets, quintuplets, etc.)

Repeated-note abbreviation may indicate repeated tuplets. A numeral represents the divisions of the initial note-value:

[musical example]

The numeral multiplies according to the number of tuplets contained within the note-value:

[musical example]

Allocate the appropriate tuplet numeral to each stem, or place it above the stave (if this is where surrounding numerals are positioned):

[musical example]

A tuplet is clearest unabbreviated at its first appearance (see When to use abbreviation, p. 223).

#### Triplets (and their multiples) in simple time

Traditionally, note-values were converted into compound time by adding duration dots:

[musical example]

It is now standard practice to notate the actual value of the initial note, to avoid confusion over duration:

[musical example]

### Tremolo definition

Measured tremolo: this is the fast repetition of notes measured exactly in a given tempo. The effect is to create audible rhythmic subdivisions of the written beats (see Measured tremolos, p. 224).

Unmeasured tremolo: this is repetition played as fast as possible, without perceptibly defined rhythm (see Unmeasured tremolos, p. 224).

The single-note tremolo: this is the rapid re-articulation of a single note or chord, which may be either measured or unmeasured.

The two-note tremolo: this is the rapid alternation (either measured or unmeasured) of two different pitches or chords (see Two-note tremolos, p. 225).

Tremolo strokes are used in woodwind and brass writing to indicate flutter-tonguing (see Flutter-tonguing, p. 247).

---

### Single-note tremolos

#### Design of the tremolo stroke

Each stroke is a little thinner than a beam (see Beams: Design, p. 17). This is so that the spaces between the strokes are slightly wider than between beams (the spacing of strokes for both is the same). Thus the strokes are less likely to fill in and obscure a rhythm when placed against stave-lines.

The stroke is the width of a notehead, and is centred on the stem.

Strokes should not be too thin or they will be inconspicuous on the stave:

[musical example]

A tremolo of only one stroke intersects a stave-line:

[musical example]

Two or more strokes must be at least one stave-space clear of a notehead, so as not to obscure it:

[musical example]

A stem should extend beyond the outermost stroke. It will need to be longer than normal to accommodate three (or more) strokes:

[musical example]

When a tremolo note has a tail or beam, extend a stem if necessary, so that the tremolo strokes are clear of tails and beams. Where there are one or two strokes, it is clearest if they centre on stave-lines:

[musical example]

If tremolo strokes intersect a tail or beam, they will obscure the duration:

**Incorrect:**

[musical example]

Tremolo strokes must stay within the stave so as not to be confused with, nor collide with, a ledger line:

[musical example]

The semibreve has the same width of tremolo stroke as other note-values, which means the strokes are slightly shorter than the width of the notehead. Centre the semibreve strokes on the notehead, and place them above or below it according to the notional position of a stem:

[musical example]

On adjacent-note chords, the strokes remain the same width as for single-note repetitions. For semibreves, the tremolo strokes centre on the note that is notionally on the 'correct' side of the stem:

[musical example]

#### Angle of strokes

Tremolo strokes slant diagonally from bottom left to top right, regardless of stem direction or beam angle:

[musical example]

In some editions, the slant is slightly steeper than the steepest beam angle. In other editions, beamed groups take strokes of beam thickness (i.e. thicker than the diagonal tremolo strokes), which are placed parallel to the beam; notes without beams have the thinner diagonal strokes (as in bar 2):

[musical example]

#### Repeated articulation

Articulation may be added for repeated-note abbreviation and measured tremolo notes. Centre on the notehead the number of articulation marks appropriate for the number of repetitions:

[musical example]

A single accent may be used if it applies to the first note only:

[musical example]

An accent may also be used to indicate the accented first note of an unmeasured tremolo:

[musical example]

#### When to use abbreviation

With measured tremolo, reserve abbreviation for extended repetition. Isolated figures should be written out in full, as they are much easier to read unabbreviated:

[musical example]

Notate tuplet abbreviations in full at their first appearance, before abbreviating them:

[musical example]

Notate fast, measured repetition in full initially, so that it is not misinterpreted as unmeasured tremolo (see below).

Unmeasured tremolo repetition is always abbreviated.

---

### Measured tremolos

It is sometimes unclear whether a tremolo should be measured or unmeasured because of inadequate specification. The abbreviation often defines the unmeasured tremolo so frequently that this notation will be read as unmeasured unless otherwise indicated.

It is therefore advisable to notate the first beat or bar of a measured tremolo in full. (It is then assumed that this same rhythm will apply to subsequent note abbreviations.) For absolute clarity, add the label *non trem.* to the first note-value of abbreviation:

[musical example]

*i.e. continuing in the rhythm of the first beat*

#### Unmeasured tremolos

The standard indication is three tremolo strokes. The notation implies that the repetition is too fast to measure in the given tempo, and therefore must be unmeasured. Should it be possible to measure the repeated notes in the given tempo, add a further tremolo stroke to each note.

Since percussionists are able to play very fast tremolos measured where even three strokes may be ambiguous, indicate *trem.* over the first note of an unmeasured tremolo passage in a moderate or slow tempo (as in the example below).

After a tremolo passage it is useful to alert the reader to the first non-tremolo note with a *non trem.* indication:

[musical example]

As long as it does not make the rhythm difficult to read, the changes of technique are best clarified with separate beaming:

[musical example]

(For percussion, see Single-note rolls, p. 293.)

#### Ties

Ties may join consecutive unmeasured tremolo notes of the same pitch to discourage any slight accent on a subsequent beat. Dotted ties are sometimes used, since the tie is not literal, but solid ties are visually less complicated to read.

Repeat an accidental over a barline should a dotted tie be used (this is unnecessary with a solid tie):

[musical example]

---

## TWO-NOTE TREMOLOS

The two-note tremolo is the alternation of two different pitches or chords:

- It is rapid alternation in an unmeasured tremolo (see Unmeasured tremolos, p. 224), and rhythmically precise alternation in a measured tremolo (see Measured tremolos, p. 224).

The two-note tremolo is notated with beams of ordinary beam thickness and centred between the stems (or notional stems) of the relevant pitches.

#### Written note-values

The two-note tremolo is a notational anomaly in that both note-values take the full duration of the tremolo:

[musical example]

Sometimes, in older scores, crotchet tremolos are joined by a quaver beam, but this is incorrect:

**Incorrect:**

[musical example]

#### Positioning tremolo beams

Except for minim tremolos, tremolo beams are not attached to stems. Minim tremolos can be beamed in one of three ways:

[musical example]

When beams and stems are separate, position the beams between the stems of the two pitches as if they were joined to the stems. However, the detached beams may move slightly closer to the noteheads than attached ones, so that stems are not forced to be greatly extended (compare the beam positions in the example above).

Both stems must point in the same direction and enclose all the beams. Stems for notes equidistant from the middle stave-line may go in either direction:

[musical example]

If the interval between the two pitches is an octave or more, it is acceptable to place the beams between the notes (both of which take conventional stem direction). This saves space outside the stave. The beams slant in the direction of the interval:

[musical example]

For semibreves, position the tremolo beams as if the semibreves were stemmed (notional stems are here represented by dotted lines):

[musical example]

It is acceptable to move semibreve beams close to noteheads, to save space outside the stave. This should be avoided if the close proximity of beams and notes or ledger lines is visually confusing:

[musical example]

#### Between two staves

For a braced part on two staves, place tremolo beams for semibreves as if the notes were beamed mid-system (notional stems are represented by dotted lines in the following example). When only one of the beams is attached to both stems (as in bar 3), the tremolo beams go below:

[musical example]

(For notation of double-stemmed beams, see p. 315.)

#### Second-note alignment

Place the second note rhythmically (not visually) exactly halfway through the duration of the tremolo.

The following examples show vertical alignment with another part in score format:

[musical example]

#### Length of tremolo beams

Beams stop just short of each stem (or the notional position of the stem on stemless notes). The distance from each stem should be the same. Thus the tremolo beams for two parts on one stave will not align precisely (this is illustrated below by dotted lines):

[musical example]

Beams for widely spaced tremolo notes may be uniformly shortened so as not to look ungainly:

[musical example]

#### Separating each two-note tremolo

It is usually helpful visually to beam individual two-note tremolos separately. Divide tremolos from each other and from non-tremolo notes:

[musical example]

#### Slurs

Attach a slur to a two-note tremolo only when this is the required articulation. A slur is essential when the second note has no separate articulation.

In wind and string notation, when the tremolo is part of a phrase with no separate articulation, do not add slurs for tremolos as well, as this causes confusion as to whether each tremolo is separately articulated (i.e. tongued or bowed) or not:

[musical example]

(See Slurs within slurs, p. 113; for wind instruments, see Articulation, p. 245; for strings, see Two-note tremolos, p. 404.)

#### Tremolos lasting more than single note-values

To tie two-note tremolos (with a solid or dotted tie) is not at all practical. The resulting visual complexity outweighs any apparent clarification of articulation. A slur for the whole figure is recommended to replace the function of the tie, i.e. to prevent rearticulation or accentuation at the beginning of subsequent notes:

[musical example]

#### Tremolos between three or more pitches

These are played by repeating the three or more pitches in sequence. All notes take the full value of the tremolo duration. When the tremolo is between three pitches, place each note one third of the way through the tremolo duration, for four notes a quarter of the way through, and so on. Centre the tremolo beams across the middle values. All the notes of a minim tremolo may be beamed together:

[musical example]

Britten adopted this clear and efficient notation in his late works (see, for example, Death in Venice).

Harp tremolos have their own notation and so do not need to be written in this way (see Tremolos and bisbigliando, p. 360).

(To notate variation in tremolo speed, see Beamed groups indicating variation in speed, p. 158; see also Variation in trill speed, p. 139.)

## REPEAT-BEAT AND REPEAT-BAR ABBREVIATION

### Using abbreviation

In full scores: abbreviation is ideally suited to the repetition of simple material where score-reading will not be unduly hampered by the abbreviation signs. For this reason, these abbreviations are appropriate in entertainment and theatre music. Abbreviation is inappropriate for complex textures, since the abbreviation signs obscure simultaneous events. Therefore, in general, this type of abbreviation is not suited to concert-music scores.

In instrumental parts: except where there is a shortage of space, it is best to fully notate repeated material, so that performers can follow by eye what they are playing. The abbreviation signs given below may, however, be used, especially for extended repetition. Avoid a one-off repeat abbreviation, unless space is very limited, as this interrupts the visual progress of the music on the page. Easily memorable material is the most suitable for abbreviation, since the reader can look onwards with the repeated bars, rather than needing to refer back to the first statement of the material and risking losing the place.

#### Repeated beats

This notation is appropriate only in instrumental parts of entertainment and theatre music.

A diagonal line of beam thickness, centred in the middle two stave-spaces, indicates repetition of the preceding beamed group. A single diagonal line represents quaver groups, two lines represent semiquaver groups, and three lines represent demisemiquaver groups:

[musical example]

Beat repetition may continue over a change of metre, provided that the written duration of the beat is unchanged:

[musical example]

If the written duration of the beat changes, the repeat should be written out with the new note-values:

[musical example]

#### Repeated chords

This notation is appropriate for indicating repeated chords with a variety of rhythms (regular, repeated rhythms should use repeated-note abbreviation: see Principles of repeated-note abbreviation, p. 219).

For note-values of less than a crotchet, stems alone may indicate repeated chords. The stems should be of identical length to the initial chord. Restate repeated pitches at the start of a new system. In an instrumental part in a fast tempo, this notation may be more helpful than the full notation of every chord, since it is immediately clear where a chord changes. It can also be space-saving:

[musical example]

Repeated crotchets: a diagonal line through the middle two stave-spaces may be used in entertainment and theatre music:

[musical example]

Minims are not abbreviated.

#### Repeated bars

These repeat signs are suitable for use in instrumental parts in all musical genres.

**Single-bar repeats**

The abbreviation for a repeated bar is a diagonal line of beam thickness, placed in the middle two stave-spaces with a bold dot on either side.

[musical example]

In order to use this abbreviation sign, the content of a bar must be an identical repetition of the previous bar; otherwise, the bar should be notated in full. A bar beginning with a tie or a slur cannot use the single-bar repeat sign:

[musical example]

Bars of tied notes alone should be written out in full:

[musical example]

A dynamic indication given in the bar to be repeated will apply to every repeated bar, unless cancelled:

[musical example]

Changes of dynamic during bars of the abbreviation sign are acceptable:

[musical example]

An abbreviation sign cannot be used after a change of metre, nor should it be placed after bars of rests. Notate the music of the repeated bar at the beginning of each system so that it is not necessary to look back to a previous system.

In instrumental parts, bars of repeat signs should be numbered. The first statement of the material (and not the first repeat) is '1' (see following example; see also Repeated bars, p. 578).

**Two-bar repeats**

For the two-bar abbreviation, parallel diagonal lines bisect the barline. The sign is used in the same way as the single-bar repeat. In an instrumental part, number each pair of bars, the first statement being '1'.

Use the two-bar repeat sign very sparingly, ideally only for a self-contained, two-bar figure. Good layout is essential so that the eye skips back to the correct place. Unless preceded by a rest, place the two-bar material at the beginning of a system; thus it will be separated visually from the music that is before it. The initial two bars should never be divided over a system break:

[musical example]

A two-bar repeat should not include whole-bar rests:

[musical example]

It should not repeat two identical single-bar repeats, nor be combined with single-bar repeat signs:

[musical example]

## REPEATED SECTIONS

### Placing repeat barlines

Repeat barlines frame a section to be repeated, except where the repeat is from the beginning of a piece, in which case no initial repeat barline is needed.

Repeat barlines may be placed at any point in the bar. At a conventional barline, they replace it. When the repeat barlines do not coincide with the metrical barline, the value of the beats at each end of the repeat must add up to a whole bar:

[musical example]

A repeated section that does not coincide with barlines (as above) may instead use first- and second-time endings, to allow repeats to coincide with (and replace) ordinary barlines. The incomplete bar is taken into a first-time bar (see First- and second-time endings, p. 236).

[musical example]

Where possible, the beginning of a repeat should coincide with a new system. This makes the section easiest to locate. When a repeated section does not coincide with the barline, incomplete bars may be placed on consecutive systems:

[musical example]

Some editions place a thin double barline at the end of a previous system where a repeat barline starts the next system.

To repeat adjacent sections, use repeat barlines back to back. Either of the following designs may be used:

[musical example]

#### Placing changes of clef, key signature and time signature

When there is a new clef, key signature or time signature at the beginning of a repeated section, place the repeat marks afterwards:

[musical example]

(If the example above were the opening of a piece, the initial repeat barline would be unnecessary.)

When a clef, key signature or time signature changes during a repeated passage, it must be reinstated for the repeat. Create a first-time bar for this information:

[musical example]

After a change in the first-time bar, a reminder in brackets of a continuing clef, key signature or time signature is helpful at the beginning of the second-time bar:

[musical example]

When the change applies to a passage that follows the repeat as well, place the warning clef, key signature or time signature at the end of the repeated section:

[musical example]

**Changes after a repeat**

A change that affects the music only after a repeat goes after the repeat barline:

[musical example]

It is useful to add reminder accidentals and dynamics in brackets for the performer returning to the beginning of a repeat:

[musical example]

#### Variation in repeat sections

When there is any variation between repeats, a repeated section should be written out in full, with the exception of the following.

When a player is silent for some of the bars within one repeat, or for a whole repeat, state this verbally over the stave, e.g. *play 1st/2nd time only* or *1st/2nd time tacet*:

[musical example]

Alternatively, when there is a very small difference, such as a single note to be played once only, this may be written as a cue note with a whole-bar rest above or beneath (see Cue notation, p. 569). Add a verbal instruction such as *1st/2nd time only*.

Dynamics or tempo changes that differ for a repeat are placed in brackets after first-time indications:

[musical example]

When instructions become complicated, a repeated passage is clearest written out in full.

(For verse repeats in vocal music, see Alternative text underlay, p. 449; for unsynchronized repetition, see Independent repetition, p. 621.)

#### First- and second-time endings

These may be indicated in English or Italian: *first time* or *prima volta*; *second time* or *seconda volta*; and *final time* or *ultima volta*.

Any variation at all between repeat endings, however small (e.g. a pause on the final ending), requires separate endings in the form of first- and second-time bars.

Brackets above the system enclose the relevant bars for each repeat. The number of repeats is given within each bracket (use numerals the size and appearance of time-signatures):

[musical example]

Place brackets in the same position as tempi: in an orchestral score, this is above the top stave and also above the strings. Tempo indications or rehearsal marks that coincide with first- and second-time bars may be placed above or within the bracket, according to available space.

#### Separate ending sections of more than a bar's length

Enclose the first-time bars (and any further repeated sections before the final-time repeat) in a bracket. Across a system break the first-time bracket is open-ended. The final section bracket extends for usually one bar only (or two short bars) and remains open-ended:

[musical example]

At the end of a piece, to look more final, run a second-time bar to the end (provided it is shorter than a whole system) and close it parallel to the final double barline.

**Bar numbers**

Some editions duplicate first- and second-time bar numbers as shown below.

If this is the case, the second-time bracket must enclose the bars that have the duplicate numbers (this will be equal to the number of first-time bars). It is also useful to number each bar, for clarity:

[musical example]

In ensemble music, it is best to number consecutively through separate endings, to avoid confusion when counting bars during rehearsal. For clarity, indicate the numbers of the first-time bars and the first second-time bar:

[musical example]

(See also Bar numbers, p. 484.)

## DA CAPO AND DAL SEGNO LAYOUTS

Section repetition using an accepted familiar layout, such as verse form in vocal music, and the minuet (or scherzo) and trio in instrumental music, requires the clear demarcation only of sections (or verses) that are to be repeated.

Where a piece involves anything other than straight repetition, the following Italian terms signpost the reader through repeated sections, replacing repeat signs:

- **Da Capo** (abbrev. D.C.) means '[repeat] from the beginning'.
- **Dal Segno** (abbrev. D.S.) means '[repeat] from the sign (marked 𝄋)'.

(In the examples below, the word Segno may be replaced or followed by 𝄋.)

Add the phrase *al Fine* ('to the end') to the above terms when the end of the piece (indicated Fine) is not at the written end of the music.

- **Da Capo al Fine** (also marked only as Da Capo) means 'from the beginning to the end' (i.e. as far as the bar marked Fine):

[musical example]

- **Dal Segno al Fine** (often marked only as Dal Segno) means 'from the sign to the end' (i.e. to Fine):

[musical example]

#### Layout with a coda

The traditional coda sign is (𝄌). When skipping to a final section or coda after a repeated section (as described above), the point of departure for the final section is marked (𝄌).

Layout is set out as follows.

- **D.C. al Coda** (also abbreviated to D.C. al 𝄌 or D.C. al (𝄌)) means 'from the beginning to the sign and then skip to the coda':

[musical example]

- **D.S. al Coda** (also abbreviated to D.S. al 𝄌 or D.S. al (𝄌)) means 'repeat from the sign 𝄋 to the sign 𝄌 and then skip to the coda'. It is important to include both signs in the instruction, to clarify which is which:

[musical example]

Be aware that the layout in the example above may be difficult to negotiate without getting lost, especially if it involves page-turns between the different sections. Rehearsal time may be used up rehearsing the geography of the piece rather than the music. In such cases, notate all or some of the repeated sections in full, so as not to risk jeopardizing a secure performance.

When the reader must skip a section to a coda, make its location conspicuous:

- Mark it with a thin double barline, the label *Coda* or 𝄌, or even use all three for added clarity (see following example)
- When the coda begins on a new system, indent the system. Place the coda label or sign above the system or, if convenient, in the indented margin of an instrumental part
- When the coda begins mid-system, where there is room, blank out a preceding section of stave and place the coda label or sign there (in a single-stave part) or above the stave (in a score or braced part):

[musical example]

Note that clef and key signature must be reinstated after the stave break. In a score, restate margin brackets as well; in a braced part, restate the curly brace.

#### Positioning the signs

The sign 𝄋 should always signal a point from which to repeat. The coda sign (𝄌) indicates a point from which to skip ahead.

The signs 𝄋 and 𝄌 go above the stave (or top stave of a system), centred over the barline.

*Da Capo*, *Dal Segno* and *Fine* instructions are written in a conspicuous font, to differentiate them from surrounding text: in a vocal score or orchestral part this might be italic, otherwise bold. Place them above the top stave of a vocal score; below the stave of a single-line part; below the bottom stave of a score or braced part.

#### Double barlines

No repeat barlines (||: :||) are used unless there are internal repeats within sections.

A thin double barline, rather than a final double barline, marks the written end of the music when this is not the end of the piece (see examples above).

Only the Fine bar, the actual end of the piece, takes a final double barline. This is regardless of whether the Fine is a whole or an incomplete bar. A thin double barline is used for repetition and departure points mid-bar. Otherwise, thin double barlines are not used at repetition and departure points that occur on barlines, unless these coincide with a new music section.

#### Positioning repeat sections

It is helpful if sections to be returned to or skipped to can begin on a new system. This visually demarcates them.

Ideally, a Fine bar in the written middle of the piece should be placed at the end of a system.

#### Bar numbers

Numbering should run consecutively through all written sections. Thus a repeated section will not have independent numbering. A section involving skipping a passage (e.g. to a coda) will have a corresponding skip in bar numbers.
