# DOTTED NOTES

Most traditional engraving uses a duration dot that is larger than a staccato dot — often twice the size.

## Placing dots relative to noteheads

Place the dot close to its notehead so that it can be spotted immediately — usually a half stave-space's distance.

Double and triple dots should be placed close together and evenly spaced:

[musical example]

When notes are in a space, place the dot in the middle of that space. When notes are on a line, place the dot in the space above:

[musical example]

(See also Double stems, p. 56.)

Dotted notes on ledger lines follow the same principle. The dot moves above the ledger line when the note is on a line:

[musical example]

Upstemmed notes with tails: should the end of a tail coincide with the position of the dot and thereby obscure it, it is acceptable to move the dot to the right of the tail:

[musical example]

It is equally acceptable to lengthen the stem.


## Chords

Every notehead in a chord must take a duration dot. Vertically align the dots after the chord:

[musical example]

### Adjacent-note chords

When the upper note is on a line, the dot moves up into the next stave-space, as usual. When the lower note is on a line, the dot drops to the lower space:

[musical example]

Each dot should always have a stave-space to itself. This same spacing applies to chords on ledger lines as well, where dots should not be bunched up just because there are no stave lines to separate them into individual spaces (see following example).

A dot may need to move a stave-space away from its notehead. Do not align the dots horizontally, as this gives double-dotted value to the notes:

[musical example]

Centre the dots on the chord, rather than placing them in one direction, away from the chord:

[musical example]

When a dot is forced to be two or more stave-spaces from the chord, its function becomes less relevant. In such cases, use only as many dots as cover the number of stave-spaces taken up by the chord:

[musical example]

## Double stems

#### LOWER PART ON A LINE

Drop the dot into the space below the lower part:

[musical example]

When the voices are close together, this avoids ambiguity as to which part the dot belongs:

[musical example]

#### Adjacent notes

Both parts dotted: the upper dot is usually aligned with the lower dot after both parts (this layout is most compact), although it is acceptable to place each dot closer to each notehead:

[musical example]

One part dotted: each dot is placed next to its notehead, even though this may force a gap between the parts (see bar 1); a dot should not be separated from its notehead by the adjacent note:

[musical example]

When the upper part is on a line, the upper dot may be placed above the lower notehead (see previous example, bar 2). However, so that the duration dot does not look like a staccato marking for the lower part, some editions place dotted upper notes to the right. Thus the dot is clear of both parts:

[musical example]

(See also Overlapping adjacent notes, below.)

#### CHORDS WITH ADJACENT NOTES

Align dots vertically for each part, independently of other chords:

[musical example]

#### Overlapping parts

Where only one part is dotted, do not separate a dot from its notehead by placing a stem in between:

[musical example]

Where both parts are dotted and conditions are cramped, the layout is more compact if both dots follow both notes:

[musical example]

#### OVERLAPPING ADJACENT NOTES

Both parts dotted: the parts may overlap:

[musical example]

One part dotted: the parts should not overlap. Place a dotted up-stemmed part to the left and separate the parts with the dot. If the up-stemmed part goes to the right, it will look as if the down-stemmed part takes the dot:

[musical example]

For a dotted down-stemmed part on a line, the dot is forced into the space above, to be clear of the up-stemmed part:

[musical example]

#### OVERLAPPING CHORDS

Place the dots beside each chord so that they are not separated from their noteheads by the other part, unless space is limited:

[musical example]

## Dotted unisons

### Single stems

Each notehead requires a dot. Each dot must have a separate stave-space, even though the noteheads are in the same space or on the same line; they will otherwise appear to be double-dotted:

[musical example]

### CHORDS WITH A PRONGED STEM

It is best to place the dots after each notehead (they are most visible in this arrangement) except in cramped conditions:

[musical example]

### Double stems

#### BOTH PARTS DOTTED
A double-stemmed unison that has one notehead requires only one dot:

[musical example]

However, the unison semibreve requires two noteheads and therefore each notehead should take a dot:

[musical example]

Unless conditions are cramped, notes of different duration take a dot beside each notehead:

[musical example]

#### ONE PART DOTTED

It is acceptable for the dotted note to share a notehead with a note without a dot as long as the rhythm of both parts is absolutely clear:

[musical example]

(This is a useful convention for repeated patterns in keyboard music — see Sharing noteheads in unison, p. 307.)

Should the rhythms appear ambiguous (the example above may well be considered inadequate), use separate noteheads as this will always be the clearest arrangement:

[musical example]

The normal arrangement is to place the upper part to the left:

[musical example]

However, there are two other equally valid approaches.

The first approach is to place the part without the dot first, to the left, so that the notes can close up. The reader infers that the dot applies to only the right-hand part, because otherwise the two parts would share the same notehead:

[musical example]

The other approach is to clarify that only one part is dotted by placing the dotted value first. Thus the dot separates the two noteheads:

[musical example]

On ledger lines: when the part placed first is dotted, separate the ledger lines. The ledger lines are not separated when only the second part takes a dot:

[musical example]
