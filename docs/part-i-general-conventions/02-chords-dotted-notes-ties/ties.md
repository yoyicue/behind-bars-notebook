# Ties

The function of a tie is to show the absence of rearticulation.

## Tie Design

The design of the tie, the curve and the gradation of the line, is a distinctive component of the appearance of the music.

A tie is a tapered arc, symmetrical in shape, which extends between two noteheads of identical pitch. Two enharmonically equivalent pitches may also be joined by a tie.

[musical example]

Square brackets should not be used as ties.

The tie and slur (phrase mark) have the same design, although ties tend to have a flatter arc, to allow room for slurs and to differentiate the two.

The tie extends from notehead to notehead: if one or both ends point to a stem, the arc becomes a slur.

[musical example]

(See Slurs, p. 109.)

### Curve of the Tie

The curve of the tie should be sufficiently round to be conspicuous through a stave-line. Ideally, a shallow tie is 1-1½ stave-spaces deep.

The center of the curve should not coincide with a stave-line, since the tie then becomes less conspicuous. This means that ties drawn within the stave will usually cut through a stave-line.

[musical example]

Ties are generally confined within one stave-space when they are very short, and when they must be flattened to avoid another part.

[musical example]

Should it be impossible to add a tie without obscuring a notehead, a tie may be divided.

The curve of a long tie is flattened to prevent excessively variable curve heights between ties.

[musical example]

Note that when chords have stems with tails, it is best to lengthen the stem to avoid tails and ties colliding.

### Positioning Ends of Tie Relative to Notehead

The exact position of the ends of a tie may vary according to surrounding notation.

Where there is plenty of space and no articulation to implement, the tie starts and finishes at the center of the notehead.

[musical example]

Where the tie needs to be brought closer to the notehead (e.g. to allow space for articulation), the ends of the tie align with the edge of the notehead.

[musical example]

The tie may start slightly after and finish slightly before the notehead. When notes are in spaces, this enables the ends of a tie to be brought into the same space as the notehead.

[musical example]

Such positioning is often necessary for tied chords. Make ties between tightly spaced notes as long as possible, in order to have them most conspicuous.

[musical example]

#### Placing Articulation and Slurs with Ties

So that a tie does not collide with articulation or slurs, the ends of the tie align with the edge of the notehead or else start slightly after and finish slightly before the notehead.

[musical example]

#### A Tie Intersecting a Stem

A tie intersects a stem only under exceptional circumstances, e.g. when two parts overlap. In all other circumstances the tie should fall short of the following stem.

[musical example]

### Placing Ties on Chords

#### Multiple-Note Chords

Inner ties must start after and finish before each notehead. Outer ties may be drawn parallel to this, so that all ties are the same length. It is equally acceptable for the outer ties to be full length.

[musical example]

For close-position chords, it is best if ties start in the same stave-space as the notehead, so that they are clearly seen to be attached to the correct note.

[musical example]

#### Adjacent-Note Chords

It is usually clearer to start each tie close to each notehead, rather than to align all ties after all notes.

[musical example]

(See also Adjacent notes, p. 66.)

### Placing Ties with Dotted Notes

#### Single Notes

Place the dot within the tie — the tie does not follow the dot. Curve the tie sufficiently to avoid obscuring the dot.

[musical example]

#### Chords

Position ties so that no dot is obscured.

Ties may start immediately after each notehead, in between the duration dots, as long as they will fit without colliding. Otherwise inner ties should start after the dots. Ties for outer notes may follow the position of inner ties if preferred, but this may place these ties rather far from their noteheads.

[musical example]

(See also Placing articulation and slurs with ties, below.)

## Tie Direction for Single Notes

### Stems in One Direction

A tie curves away from the stems of the notes.

[musical example]

A tie between stemless notes behaves as if stems were present.

[musical example]

### Consecutive Stems in Opposite Directions

Ties curve away from the middle stave-line.

[musical example]

To curve all ties upwards for notes below the middle line, as some editions do, creates a collision between a tie and the tail of an up-stemmed first note.

[musical example]

(However, this may be unavoidable in double-stemmed writing)

### Ties Over a System Break

A tie stops short of the last barline of a system. At the start of a new system the tie begins after the clef, key signature and time signature.

Tie direction remains consistent over the system break and should not be altered when the notes on either side of it take opposite stem direction.

[musical example]

Over a system break, the open-ended tie keeps its symmetrical shape. This symmetrical curve ensures it is not mistaken for a slur nor a glissando line.

[musical example]

## Tie Direction on Single-Stemmed Chords

Two notes on a stem: the ties curve in opposite directions.

[musical example]

An even number of ties: equal numbers of ties curve in each direction.

[musical example]

An odd number of ties: the majority of ties curve away from the stem.

[musical example]

Some editions tie middle notes of both odd- and even-note chords according to their position on the stave. Ties for notes on and above the middle stave-line curve upwards, ties for notes below the middle line curve downwards.

[musical example]

(See also Adjacent notes, p. 66.)

#### Distance Apart of Ties

Place ties that are in the same direction a minimum of one stave-space apart. This applies to ties both on and outside the stave. One tie per stave-space prevents the ties from obscuring stave-lines or merging together.

[musical example]

#### On Ledger Lines

Either flatten the ties or move them horizontally further from the noteheads in order to avoid them touching ledger lines.

[musical example]


### Adjacent Notes

Adjacent-note ties are curved away from each other. This avoids two ties close together curving in the same direction. The adjacent notes dictate the direction of all other ties in the chord, overruling the usual tie-direction conventions for the rest of the chord.

[musical example]

#### Pairs of Adjacent Notes

Each pair may take opposite tie directions as long as the middle ties do not collide nor overlap.

[musical example]

#### Consecutive Adjacent Notes

Curve parallel ties in both directions away from the middle of the chord. Position the ties outwards from the center of the chord, one per stave-space. Each tied note must have a tie; therefore the ties at the edges of the chord will be progressively further away vertically from the notes to which they refer.

[musical example]

## Tie Direction in Double-Stemmed Writing

The upper part takes upward-curving ties, the lower part downward-curving ties.

[musical example]

This applies to all the notes on one stem.

[musical example]

### Overlapping Parts

#### One Part Tied

When the parts are not tied simultaneously, the ties curve towards their stems as normal.

[musical example]

Where possible, place the parts so that a stem does not come between a note and its tie. This may involve reversing the usual arrangement of parts.

[musical example]

#### Both Parts Tied

Ties may curve away from their stems if necessary, so that they are clear of each other.

[musical example]

One tie should never intersect another, since this is visually confusing: either reverse normal tie direction or else divide up the tie.

Note that the tie may cut through the stem of the other part, rather than curve a long way from the notehead, which makes the tie look too similar to a slur.

[musical example]

A stem should not end at the point it meets the tie. Either shorten or lengthen the stem. A tie may cut through the stems of a beamed group as long as the tie is sufficiently curved and does not look like another beam.

[musical example]

(See also extract from Carter's Syringa, p. 382.)

#### With Ledger Lines

A tie should not pass between ledger lines. A tie by nature should be kept as flat as possible, to distinguish it from a slur. Therefore it is sometimes clearest to break the tie.

[musical example]

When a tie is not required to overlap with another, it is clearest not to break it. It may be moved further from the notes while being kept reasonably flat. When the curve of the tie is too rounded, it looks too much like a slur.

[musical example]

Whether or not the parts overlap, never allow a tie to intersect the other part's ledger lines.

(See first example on p. 306, (b).)

#### Chords Tied Without a Change of Pitch

The ties for unchanging chords revert to their conventional positions.

(To position ties between staves in keyboard writing, see Ties between staves, p. 308; see also Arpeggiated chords notated as consecutive pitches, p. 133; for use of ties with tremolos, see Ties, p. 225.)

## Tied Unisons

### Single Stems

#### Perfect Unisons

Each notehead requires its own tie.

The ties should point to and from each notehead, with the upper tie for the note on the left and the lower tie for the note on the right.

[musical example]

A stem should not intersect a tie.

Ties must not overlap nor cross; it is better to point the ties to the 'wrong' notehead.

[musical example]

#### Altered Unisons

Each tie should be drawn between its own noteheads.

[musical example]

### Double Stems

Each part must have its own tie, even though there is only one notehead and one duration dot.

[musical example]

A single tie indicates that only one part is tied; however, when this is the case, it is clearest to use two noteheads.

[musical example]

When the parts have different durations, it is acceptable to reverse the order of noteheads so that a notehead can be nearer its tie.

[musical example]

When one part is also dotted, the part with the dot may go to the right, so that the notes can close up.

## Tie Direction for Single-Stemmed Moving Chords

For clarity, a moving part usually takes a separate stem, but where this is not possible, tied and untied notes may appear on the same stem. To draw attention to a note-change in a chord, curve ties away from an added or released note.

[musical example]

When one note is added whilst another is released on alternate sides of a tied note, obviously the tie direction cannot be curved away from both. Usually the tie is curved away from a note added for the second chord.

[musical example]

The tie can be reversed away from the added note if it would otherwise be unclear which note was tied.

[musical example]

A passage of such chords looks clearest when all ties are placed in one direction.

[musical example]

Ties are placed conventionally when notes are added or released simultaneously above and below the tied note.

[musical example]

Curve a tie away from an added note with an accidental, so that the two do not collide.

#### With Slurs

When a slur connects chords, place ties and slurs in opposite directions so as to be clearly distinguishable from one another.

[musical example]

#### Chords Tied Without a Change of Pitch

The ties for unchanging chords revert to their conventional positions.

## Open Ties

A short, open (or 'incomplete') tie is used to show that a note is sustained beyond its written duration. This is also indicated laissez vibrer.

A long tie extending to a rest or barline indicates that a note should be held for its full length.

[musical example]

A short open-ended tie extending from the notehead is used in some French editions to replace the longer complete tie. This should not be used, as it does not show the progression of the tied note sufficiently clearly.

[musical example]

Such ties should be used only where no other solution is practical.

### Laissez Vibrer

(French, 'leave to vibrate', Italian: lasciar vibrare; abbrev. l.v.)

This is an instruction not to damp an instrument that has natural sustaining resonance. The instruction applies to sounds that are sustained naturally by an instrument, not held manually, and which are not to be damped until indicated (if at all).

The instruction l.v. sempre specifies that no notes in a passage are to be damped.

The initial note is best written as a single note-value, as this is easiest to read; l.v. is written after the note. This may be accompanied by an open tie, although l.v. or a tie alone is sufficient.

[musical example]

The instruction l.v. al niente indicates that the sound should be allowed to die away to nothing.

When a sound is to be damped later on, the continuing resonance is indicated with open ties over or after subsequent barlines. Add rests to make up the value of incomplete bars. Rests may be omitted for whole bars, but are best added for completeness.

[musical example]

Rests may be divided up to show a damping or pedal release point in the middle of a bar.

It is better not to indicate the termination (release) point with a tied note-value, unless all durations are written in full, since at a quick glance it may look as if the sound should be re-articulated.

[musical example]

#### Notes Sustained with a Pedal

Instruments that can sustain notes with pedals (piano, celesta, vibraphone) do not require l.v. ties for notes that are sustained in this way, since pedal markings must be indicated in any case. Once a note is struck, the sound will be sustained until the pedal is released. Continued notation of the sustained notes for the duration of the pedal is unnecessarily complicated.

[musical example]

(For exceptions in piano writing, see Notes sustained with a pedal, p. 337; for l.v. percussion notation, see Long-reverberating instruments, p. 289; for harp, see Laissez vibrer, p. 363; for guitar, see Sustaining and damping, p. 383.)
