# Chords

## Single-stemmed Chords

Two or more notes of the same duration are combined onto one stem to form a chord:

[musical example]

Notes of different duration can be combined onto one stem for a chord only in string writing:

[musical example]

This is because the bow can sustain only two notes at once (see Triple- and quadruple-stopping, p. 398).

In all other cases, notes of different duration must take separate stems. The upper part takes up-stems, and the lower part takes down-stems (see Double-stemmed writing, p. 52):

[musical example]

## Stem Direction

The notehead furthest away from the centre of the stave determines the stem direction. When this note is above the middle line, the chord takes a down-stem; when the note is below the middle line, the chord takes an up-stem:

[musical example]

Stems joining noteheads that are equidistant from the centre of the stave can go in either direction, although many editions use only down-stems:

[musical example]

As with stem direction of single notes (see Stem direction, p. 13), the direction may be determined by context. The aim is to achieve a consistent stem direction within a phrase, bar or half-bar:

[musical example]

## Chords with Three or More Notes

The stem direction is still determined by whichever of the chord's outer notes is furthest from the centre of the stave:

[musical example]

Where the outer notes are equidistant from the centre of the stave, stem direction is determined by the position of the majority of notes. When the majority is above the middle stave-line, the chord takes a down stem; when the majority is below the middle line, the chord takes an up-stem:

[musical example]

The following chords have all notes equidistant from the centre of the stave and so can take either stem direction:

[musical example]

## Adjacent-note Chords

### Single stems

#### Two adjacent notes

To write intervals a second apart, place the lower note on the left-hand side of the stem, the upper note on the right-hand side:

[musical example]

Adjacent-note chords slope diagonally from bottom left to top right, even when this means a repeated note changes stem-side from chord to chord:

[musical example]

#### More than two adjacent notes

The majority of notes fall on the 'correct' side of the stem. Thus when there are an odd number of notes, the lowest note goes on the left-hand side for up-stems, and on the right-hand side for down-stems:

[musical example]

When there is an even number of notes, the lowest note always goes on the left-hand side of the stem:

[musical example]

The French system of placing the highest and lowest notes on the 'correct' side of the stem should not be followed, since often this forces the lower of two adjacent notes to the right (rather than to the left) side of the stem:

[musical example]

### Double stems

Arrange chords so that notes on the 'correct' side of each stem align vertically:

[musical example]

(This same principle should be used to align adjacent-note chords in a score - see Vertical alignment, p. 490.)

The only exception is when a tone or semitone separates the two parts. In this case, the lower part is displaced to the right (if the parts are vertically aligned, it is hard to tell which note belongs to which part):

[musical example]

(See also Offsetting unison and adjacent noteheads, p. 53.)

## Stemless Notes

Stemless noteheads are arranged as if they were stemmed:

[musical example]

## Chords with Single-stemmed Unison Notes

### Perfect unisons

Place one notehead each side of the stem.

[musical example]

(For Dotted unisons, see p. 58.)

### Altered unisons

Place each notehead after its own accidental in ascending chromatic order (flat to sharp).

Usually a note is displaced to the right of a chord, and joined to the vertical stem by a diagonal one. Position the diagonal so as to avoid cutting through (and thereby obscuring) the second accidental.

[musical example]

Extend the vertical stem beyond the point where the diagonal joins it. Any tails or beams should be clear of the diagonal stem.

[musical example]

Occasionally, it is more convenient to displace a note before the rest of the chord, for example when there is more space available before rather than after the chord. Another part would align with the stem.

A two-note chord can, alternatively, splay out from the vertical stem in both directions, using a branching stem.

[musical example]

In very cramped conditions, it is acceptable to place one notehead each side of the stem with both accidentals before both notes. This notation is compact but much less clear, since an accidental is always best placed beside the notehead to which it applies. If this layout is used, both notes must have accidentals, or the two pitches will appear to be the same. The order of accidentals for a chord containing a sharp and a natural sign is #♮, since ♮# might appear to be a sharp cancelling a double-sharp sign.

[musical example]

An accidental must never be placed after the note to which it refers, since a note cannot be modified once it has been sounded.

[musical example]

(See also Accidentals in double-stemmed writing: Altered unisons, p. 91.)

### In a note cluster

All noteheads must be attached to a stem so that they are immediately identified as part of the chord. It is not enough that a notehead touches another notehead.

[musical example]

#### Stemless notes

A square bracket should encompass simultaneous notes. Align another part with the first notehead, or otherwise where the stem of an adjacent-note chord would be.

[musical example]

(See also Keyboard: Note clusters, p. 326.)

## Double-stemmed writing

The upper part always takes up-stems, the lower part down-stems, even when pitches overlap (see Overlapping parts, p. 53).

### Unisons

Two parts with the same note-value may share a notehead as long as they take two stems.

[musical example]

Notes without stems take a separate notehead for each part.

[musical example]

A black notehead can be shared by any black-note durations.

[musical example]

Semibreves, minims and black noteheads should be kept separate from each other.

[musical example]

(See also Dotted unisons, p. 58; for keyboard-writing conventions, see Sharing noteheads in unison, p. 307.)

### Offsetting unison and adjacent noteheads

Offset the lower part to the right. Vertically align the upper part with a part on another stave:

[musical example]

Exceptions to this rule occur when parts overlap (see below; also, Overlapping parts, p. 57); and when double-stemmed adjacent or unison notes have only one dotted part (see Adjacent notes, p. 56, and Dotted unisons: One part dotted, p. 59).

Keep noteheads separate; stems should not touch. Semibreves in particular should not appear to be joined to stems:

[musical example]

Some editions reverse the order of noteheads so that the semibreve is never adjacent to a stem. The part on the left aligns vertically with a part on another stave (this is the case whichever the notehead arrangement):

[musical example]

### Overlapping parts

Place a down-stemmed part to the left so that noteheads can overlap. Slightly separate the parts so that the stems do not appear to include both notes. As with adjacent and unison noteheads, it is the part on the left that aligns with a part on another stave:

[musical example]

This is more compact than the following.

[musical example]

Place a down-stemmed part to the left for overlapping adjacent notes.

[musical example]

Overlapping semibreves must be divided into stemmed notes in order to show part progression.

[musical example]

(For arrangement with ledger-line notes, see Double-stemmed adjacent notes and overlapping parts, p. 27.)
