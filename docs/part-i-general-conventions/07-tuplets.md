## Definition

A tuplet is rhythmic division that does not divide into standard groups of two or three. Such groups are considered to be 'irregular' to the regular two (J beat, etc.) or three (J. beat, etc.) division. Their notation relies on adding numerals to show their different division. The difference is conceived as a distortion of the standard values. (Henry Cowell, in his New Musical Resources, created an imaginative alternative notation by using different-shaped noteheads for each division of the beat, although he did not apply his theory within many of his works.)

## The tuplet numeral

### Design and placing

The tuplet numeral is printed in italic to differentiate it from numbers referring to fingering (see p. 308) or players (see example under Placing player numerals, p. 528), both of which are given in roman type. The height of the numeral is 1½ stave-spaces.

Place the numeral at the visual centre of the group. Thus, where the tuplet is evenly spaced, an odd-numbered numeral centres on the middle duration:

[musical example]

An even-numbered numeral centres between the two middle durations:

[musical example]

When the middle note of a tuplet subdivides, the numeral centres between an even number of subdivisions (a) and on the middle duration of an odd number of subdivisions (b):

[musical example]

## The tuplet bracket

### Design

The numeral should be encompassed by a square bracket, and not the curved arc of older editions, as this looks like a slur:

[musical example]

The bracket is broken for the numeral on which it centres vertically:

[musical example]

An unbroken bracket may be used and the numeral placed inside the bracket, but this arrangement takes up more vertical space than necessary:

[musical example]

### Length of brackets

A bracket should extend from the left-hand edge of the first notehead or rest, to the right-hand edge of the final notehead or rest. It does not encompass accidentals, grace notes or an arpeggio line that precede the first note. When a final note is up-stemmed and has a tail, the bracket still finishes with the stem (i.e. the right-hand edge of the note), not with the tail:

[musical example]

In some editions brackets finish just after the tail: this saves vertical space, as the end notch can be lowered after the stem.

### Tuplets ending with the longest duration

Traditionally, the bracket extends only as far as the last written duration:

[musical example]

Thus a numeral centred in a bracket occurs before the central duration, making the rhythm unnecessarily difficult to read. It is now usual to extend the bracket to the position of the hypothetical final division of the tuplet, so that the numeral occurs at the rhythmic centre of the group. This makes complex rhythms quicker to read:

[musical example]

When the whole tuplet is beamed, either place the numeral in the middle of the beam:

[musical example]

or enclose the tuplet in a bracket that extends as far as the final (invisible) tuplet division. This allows the numeral to be at the rhythmic centre of the group:

[musical example]

However, such groups often occupy so small a place that there is, in practice, no room to extend a bracket.

### Aligning brackets between parts

Bracket ends should align between tuplets of the same division:

[musical example]

When the final division of a tuplet is subdivided in some parts but not in others, the bracket ends need to extend only as far as the last duration in each group. This means that brackets may finish at different points. If preferred, all brackets may be extended to the position of the longest bracket. There is a visual logic to this, especially as uniform bracket length will allow the centred tuplet numerals to align vertically:

[musical example]

When dissimilar tuplets are present, the bracket lengths will also vary:

[musical example]

(For tuplet alignment, see Table 1, p. 201.)

### Angle of brackets

#### Groups without beams

Brackets may slant in the direction of the tuplet's outer pitches:

[musical example]

The angle of the slant should not be too acute; match an equivalent beam slant:

[musical example]

Alternatively, brackets may remain horizontal. For a line of undulating groups this avoids the visual distraction of many sloping brackets:

[musical example]

#### Beamed groups

When a bracket encloses beamed notes, it should be parallel to the beams:

[musical example]

When the beams within a tuplet are in different directions, the bracket should remain horizontal:

[musical example]

The bracket should also remain horizontal where it would otherwise slope into the stave, causing a collision of lines that would obscure it:

[musical example]

(To place tuplet indications for groups across two staves in keyboard writing, see Placing tuplet indications, p. 319.)

### Placing tuplet indications

A tuplet indication normally goes to the stem side of the notes, since this is where one would expect to read the rhythm. This keeps the space on the notehead side clear for articulation and slurs:

[musical example]

However, in performance material with a passage requiring many ledger lines, tuplet indication may be best placed on the notehead side, as the distance between the notehead and the end of the stem is so great:

[musical example]

For groups with mixed stem direction, the indication can go on either side of the note. It is often best placed above the stave, as the most important consideration is that it is clear of slurs, articulation and hairpins:

[musical example]

In a different context, however, indications may be best placed with the majority of stems.

If it is distracting that brackets continually alternate above and below the stave, place all brackets above the stave. The reader then becomes accustomed to seeing tuplets in one place, which helps fast reading:

[musical example]

#### Brackets and slurs

When a bracket is longer than a slur, it goes outside the slur. When a bracket is shorter than a slur, it goes inside it:

[musical example]

Place the bracket outside a slur if the two would otherwise intersect:

[musical example]

#### Double-stemmed writing

Place brackets and numerals at the stem end of both parts. They should be further from the stave than articulation marks and also from slurs that are shorter than the brackets:

[musical example]

#### Proximity to the stave

Always place the bracket outside the stave. The bracket ends and the edge of a numeral may intersect a stave-line:

[musical example]

### When to use brackets

Use brackets to enclose partially beamed groups and groups without beams:

[musical example]

The bracket must enclose all the values of the tuplet, including rests:

[musical example]

A tuplet numeral placed on the notehead side of a group should be enclosed in a bracket to make it conspicuous:

[musical example]

When the whole tuplet is beamed, it is not necessary to have a bracket, provided the numeral is next to the beam:

[musical example]

The same is true when beams extend to enclose complete beats that include rests at either or both ends:

[musical example]

A bracket must be used where a tuplet is only part of a complete beam, since the numeral might otherwise appear to apply to the entire beam:

[musical example]

Conversely, if there is likely to be ambiguity, a bracket should clarify that all the durations joined by a beam are part of the tuplet:

[musical example]

## Rhythmic alignment

Tuplets must align rhythmically with all other parts (see Table 1, opposite). As with alignment in a score containing a variety of subdivided beats, this may well disrupt even spacing in another part. In the example below, the upper stave's rhythm is evenly spaced at the expense of the lower stave's rhythm. This helps reading the more complex part:

[musical example]

(See also Vertical alignment, p. 490.)

### Table 1: Alignment between ratios

[musical example]

## How to calculate alignment

Either multiply the two ratio figures, or use the lowest common multiple. The resulting figure is the number of units to plot on a horizontal axis. Calculate the spacing of the tuplet by dividing the number of units by the tuplet:

[musical example]

Groups of mixed note-values:

Identify the shortest duration of the first tuplet (x):

[musical example]

(If one of the groups is not a tuplet, identify the shortest duration of the beat.)

Identify the shortest duration of the second tuplet (y):

[musical example]

Find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of (x) and (y):

[musical example]

Use this number of units to plot the ratio:

[musical example]

## Note-value of the tuplet

### Principles

There are two ways to notate note-values that do not divide according to standard beat division.

Option 1 is to add extra notes to the beat until the next standard division. This can be expressed as a contracting ratio: keep the number on the left side of the ratio larger than the number on the right (see 'tuplet ratio' column). Where the left-hand number doubles the right-hand number, add another beam instead:

[musical example]

### Compound-time duplet divisions

#### Traditional notation

Traditional practice gives duplets and quadruplets their shorter equivalent durations even though this contradicts the contracting ratio method outlined above. 2:3 is the expanding ratio. The logic for this practice is, firstly, that the numeral acts as a substitute for a duration dot:

[musical example]

Secondly, when the beat remains the same, equivalent durations have identical notation in both simple- and compound-time metres. For example, where the metric equation is E J = S J. the result is:

[musical example]

It is quite acceptable to use this traditional notation in a context where there are no tuplets more complicated than duplets or quadruplets. Where other ratios are required as well, use the contemporary notation for all ratios as described opposite.

Another convention sometimes used is to add duration dots to duplets and quadruplets while retaining the numerals. This is incorrect — the numerals are self-sufficient:

[musical example]

(See also Dotted values, below.)

#### Contemporary notation

There are two equally valid ways of notating duplet division.

Contracting ratio: notes can be added to the beat until the next standard subdivision is reached. 4:3 is the contracting ratio:

[musical example]

(If this method is used, all other tuplet durations should also take a contracting ratio: 5:3, 7:6 etc.)

Dotted values: duplet-beat divisions can take equivalent durations as dotted notes (or rests) and do not need to be written as tuplets:

[musical example]

Other tuplets may also relate to the dotted-note division:

[musical example]

When using this notation, indicate the tuplet ratio and its dotted note-value at first appearance, since the sum of the ratio note-values is not an obvious division of a compound beat.

If these dotted divisions are used, all tuplets should consistently take this notation, since otherwise shorter note-values (the quintuplets below) look slower than longer values:

[musical example]

### Table 3: Tuplet note-values in compound time

[musical example]

For a dotted beat, double the note-values:

[musical example]

(For use of the alternative notation above, see Carter extract, p. 517.)

## Stating the tuplet ratio in full

Context: it is quite acceptable to use either contracting ratios or dotted notes according to whichever is most appropriate to the context:

[musical example]

Numerals are easier to read than dotted notes except for the occasional group. The dotted divisions produce a more complicated visual image, and the reader is likely to stumble at the sudden arrival of lots of dots.

When there are extensive passages of duplets, it may be simpler to change time signature to reflect the different beat divisions (see Interchanging simple- and compound-time metres, p. 172).

State the full ratio where the tuplet is a non-standard length:

[musical example]

(The figure '5' alone would normally be 5:4 in a crotchet beat.)

In compound time, this also avoids ambiguity: for example, as to whether fi5fi : 5:3 or 5:6.

The ratio should also be stated when the tuplet rhythm contains mixed note-values, and the note-value of the division is not immediately obvious:

[musical example]

When a whole bar is divided into equal tuplet values it is usually unnecessary to use a full ratio (see Table 4, p. 209).

(See also Labelling a tuplet of mixed note-values, p. 213.)

How to notate the ratio:

Notate the ratio using a colon for 'in the time of'. Where possible, express both sides of the ratio in terms of the same note-value:

[musical example]

Where the ratio cannot be expressed with the same note-value, substitute written note-values for the duration of the tuplet (see Groups with no literal ratio equivalents, below).

Do not notate the duration of a tuplet as an initial extra note-value, as this looks like another musical part:

**Incorrect:**

[musical example]

### Groups with no literal ratio equivalents

Where the duration of the tuplet is itself irregular — e.g. a whole bar of, say, 3 or 9 — there is no straightforward unit of division against which to measure the irregularity. Notate the tuplet so as to convey an impression of equal division within the allotted duration, even though it has no literal ratio equivalent.

For division within durations of five and seven beats, select the note-value for the tuplet according to the contracting-ratio principle:

[musical example]

For equal division of more unusual durations, indicate note-values on the right-hand side of the ratio to define the tuplet duration:

[musical example]

For rhythms indicated in Table 4, when a tempo is very slow or ensemble is critical, it may be more helpful to subdivide the bar so as to expose its beats (see 'actual rhythm' column) rather than to use contracting ratios (see Degree of note division within tuplets, p. 210):

[musical example]

### Table 4: Groups with no literal ratio equivalents

[musical example]

## Degree of note division within tuplets

Tuplets may be subdivided to expose the beats of a bar when this would be helpful for ensemble purposes. The degree of note division depends on two things: the tempo, and how critical it is that the performer accurately places each note against a beat.

Undivided tuplets disregard the stresses of the written metre, in order to emphasize a fluent musical line:

[musical example]

Tuplets that expose the middle beat help the placing of rhythms against the middle of the bar:

[musical example]

When the performer needs to count each beat, expose each beat. Since performers will mark in the position of the beats that they need to 'think', it is helpful if the notation provides this:

[musical example]

The composer's perceived disadvantage of this notation is that it may encourage slight jerkiness or unwitting accentuation as the performer places each rhythm against the beat. To counteract this tendency, add a term such as legato and scorrevole ('flowing').

### Across a barline

An unbroken tuplet bracket or beam may be extended between two bars. The first note-value in the second bar comes after the beginning of the bar, aligned as if the tuplet were subdivided across the barline:

[musical example]

When it is more helpful to do so, subdivide tuplets to expose the beginning of each bar, as above.

When the tuplet is undivided across the barline, the number of notes on each side must be correct, as in the previous example.

**Incorrect:**

[musical example]

## Rests within a tuplet

Keep separate rests for each division of a tuplet where this clarifies division.

It can be clearer not to present rests in their most abbreviated durations:

[musical example]

However, it is best to amalgamate rests within groups of short durations, so that the groups can be read more quickly:

[musical example]

## Tuplet beaming

### Groups with single beams

Beam each tuplet separately to give the rhythmic groupings maximum clarity:

[musical example]

It is usually best to separate tuplets from other beamed notes, as the rhythms are then much clearer to read:

[musical example]

(To show how a bracket can clarify the extent of a tuplet, see When to use brackets, p. 199.)

### Groups with inner beams

The outer beam can join together subdivided units as long as the inner beam is divided for each tuplet. Undivided inner beams obscure the rhythm:

[musical example]

### Beaming and labelling subdivided tuplets according to accentuation

It is important to separate the innermost beams to reflect the correct subdivision of a tuplet.

When it is the tuplet itself that subdivides, the numeral indicates the division of the whole group (and not the subdivisions). This is how the rhythm is stressed (see bracketed accents), and the beaming should reflect this accentuation (Table 5, first column).

When two groups of tuplets are joined by one beam, either each group takes a separate tuplet numeral, or the sum of the numerals appears as one centred numeral:

[musical example]

### Table 5: Beaming and labelling subdivided tuplets according to accentuation

[musical example]

#### Differentiating triplets from sextuplets

A triplet is always a tripartite division, whereas a sextuplet is two groups each of three notes, a bipartite division. It is incorrect to beam a triplet without subdividing the beams, as the division would then be unclear:

[musical example]

Group rests according to the correct rhythmic division:

[musical example]

#### Labelling a tuplet of mixed note-values

Such subdivided tuplets should use the numeral with the smallest multiple, i.e. the numeral for the division of the whole group, and not the smallest note-value:

[musical example]

(See also Stating the tuplet ratio in full, p. 207.)

## Tuplets within tuplets

### Placing numerals and brackets

Enclose the tuplet numeral for the entire division in a bracket so that it is clear it applies to the whole group. A numeral for a subdivided group requires a bracket only when the numeral is on the notehead side of the group (see When to use brackets, p. 199).

[musical example]

Where there is room, place one tuplet indication on either side of the group. The indication for the whole group should go on the stem side.

[musical example]

When all other tuplet indications in a passage are above the stave, place the indication for the whole group above the stave.

[musical example]

When both tuplet indications need to be on the same side of the group, place the indication for the whole tuplet furthest from the group:

[musical example]

When a triplet subdivides into further triplets the note values look slower than their longer standard-division equivalents:

[musical example]

However, when nine notes are in the time of a crotchet and the tuplet group is to be without internal accentuation, this can be written as follows:

[musical example]

## Tuplet repetition

Groups of identical rhythmic patterns may drop the numeral after a bar or two, provided that the rhythmic grouping remains clear:

[musical example]

However, when there is complex rhythmic alignment in a full score, numerals are best included throughout so that the conductor can see the alignment at a glance.

Tuplets of repeated single notes or chords may be abbreviated:

[musical example]

In both cases, sim. may be added for clarity once the numeral is omitted.

(See Tuplet division (triplets, quintuplets, etc.), p. 219.)
