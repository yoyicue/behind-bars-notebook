# 4. Dynamics and Articulation

## Dynamics

### Typography

All wording referring to dynamics uses an italic typeface. A stylized bold italic gives symbols p, f, m, s and z an individual and weighty appearance. No other text with the music should be as conspicuous. Relative to the stave, the f is 2½ stave-spaces high, the p is 2 spaces. The m (as in mezzo), s and z (as in sf and fz) are the height of a stave-space. Other wording for dynamics such as cresc., dim., sempre, is the same size and should use lower-case italic but never a bold typeface.

### General conventions for placing dynamics

Place dynamics below the stave for instruments that use only a single stave.

All parts on one stave are assumed to have a common dynamic (placed below the stave) unless otherwise specified. This is regardless of whether the parts are stemmed together or separately. When parts sharing a stave have individual dynamics, each part must take separate stems. Dynamics for the up-stemmed part are then placed above the stave (see following section; see also Stave sharing: Dynamics, p. 528).

For vocal music, dynamics go above the stave to avoid conflict with the text (see Placing dynamics, expression marks and technical instructions, p. 434).

For braced parts (keyboard and harp), dynamics usually go between the two staves (see Placing dynamics, p. 323; for organ, see Placing tempi and dynamics, p. 343).

In a score, two adjacent staves of the same instrumental family may share a line of dynamics, centred between the two staves, the sharing indicated with a brace [ (see Sharing performance instructions, p. 525).

(For placing dynamics with grace notes, see Dynamics, p. 130.)

### Placing dynamics relative to the stave

Dynamics should always be placed as close as possible to the notes to which they refer so that they cannot be overlooked. However, other markings — such as those for articulation, slurs, octave signs and tuplet brackets — are required to be closer to notes, so add these markings to the music before positioning dynamics:

[musical example]

Hairpins (< >) should never intersect a stave-line (although this occasionally occurs in keyboard writing: see Placing hairpins with double-stemmed beams, p. 323). A dynamic or hairpin placed on the stave becomes inconspicuous — at worst illegible.

Under exceptional conditions, a dynamic marking may be allowed to encroach into the outer stave-spaces, e.g. to minimize vertical space requirements in a large full score. This is also permissible in choral music, to prevent the dynamic colliding with the text of a voice part above:

[musical example]

When a middle voice requires a separate dynamic, this must be placed beside its notehead:

[musical example]

Note that in order to be legible, the bowl of p must intersect a line (and not sit in a space); the crossbar of f must not fall on a line.

#### Vertical alignment of dynamic symbols

Centre the dynamic on the notehead:

[musical example]

When a closely following note takes a different dynamic, three or more characters (e.g. fff) move to the left so that the last character aligns with the notehead:

[musical example]

(See also Breaking a barline for a dynamic, below.)

When vertical space is limited, move a dynamic to the left of the note — never to the right, since the note has already started:

[musical example]

#### Breaking a barline for a dynamic

It is acceptable to have a break in a barline for text such as technical instructions and expression marks and for dynamic symbols (but not for hairpins — see Through barlines, p. 105). However, it is always best to have continuous barlines if markings can be moved before or after the barline.

Move an initial dynamic to the right of a barline if possible. Make a break in a barline for a dynamic that cannot move right:

[musical example]

#### Crescendo/diminuendo signs (Hairpins)

Hairpins are the thickness of a stave-line. The open end should not be more than two stave-spaces wide. The open ends of complementary hairpins should match in width, and align horizontally:

[musical example]

The intensity of a dynamic change is not reflected by the openness of a hairpin, which maintains the same width regardless of dynamic:

[musical example]

(See also Using crescendo/diminuendo signs or text, p. 106.)

#### Extending over a system break

A diminuendo hairpin remains open at the end of a system; a crescendo hairpin is left open at the beginning of the new system. A hairpin stops with the final barline and begins with the first note of the new system (or just before):

[musical example]

#### Horizontal placing

A hairpin will always be a very precise length: this is its great advantage. Therefore it must be carefully placed or its significance will change:

[musical example]

Do not place a hairpin before a note is started, nor after a note is finished. A hairpin should start at the first relevant notehead (not accidental) and end with the following notehead or at the first rest thereafter. Good practice is to start the hairpin on the left-hand edge of the note and to finish it on the right-hand edge of a note:

[musical example]

(If a dynamic symbol is present, the hairpin starts later and finishes earlier, so that the dynamic centres on the notehead or chord.)

When precision is important, subdivide note-values so that dynamics can be placed precisely:

[musical example]

#### Through barlines

A hairpin may cut through a barline, but should not start nor finish on a barline. It is neatest if a hairpin that terminates at the beginning of a bar stops short of the barline, since the space between the barline and the subsequent first beat has no time value. However, it is helpful to extend a hairpin to a first beat that is some distance after a barline, to show continuity:

[musical example]

#### Horizontal alignment

When a sequence of changing dynamics involves hairpins, keep such markings on the same horizontal plane whenever possible. The eye most easily follows a progression of dynamics running parallel to the stave:

[musical example]

It is sometimes necessary to tilt hairpins so that they will fit into a vertically compact score.

In performance material, for clarity, it is important to keep dynamics as close as possible to the notes to which they refer. A hairpin may slope to follow the contour of the pitches, so that it visibly relates to its beginning and ending dynamics (where these are present). Avoid steep gradients if possible:

[musical example]

A sequence of dynamics at different vertical positions should be avoided as the dynamics will appear unconnected and be difficult to follow:

[musical example]

### Using crescendo/diminuendo signs or text

Use hairpins rather than words for a short crescendo or diminuendo, as they are quicker to read and are more conspicuous. However, long hairpins confuse the eye, as the long lines are virtually parallel to the stave. Instead, use the terms crescendo (abbrev. cresc.), diminuendo (abbrev. dim.) or decrescendo (abbrev. decresc).

Widely spaced dashes or dots following on from these indications may be used to identify the duration of the dynamic change — usually to a specified final dynamic (the following example would be stretched over several bars):

[musical example]

A reminder in brackets (CRESC.)/(dim.) is useful at the beginning of a new system.

#### Qualifying dynamic change

**Verbal qualification**

Terms such as poco a poco, più, molto and meno alert the reader to:

- a gradual change over a long passage (e.g. cresc. poco a poco)
- a sudden change (e.g. dim. molto)
- a change from a preceding pattern:

[musical example]

Qualifying text should be placed above or below a hairpin — to place text inside a hairpin obscures the text or opens up the hairpin too much:

[musical example]

Qualifying text occurring before or after a hairpin is ambiguous as it appears to refer to the starting or finishing dynamic:

[musical example]

#### Interim dynamics

Dynamics may be added at strategic points during a long crescendo or diminuendo, e.g. for a new phrase or after rests. This is a precautionary measure to advise the performer not to change the dynamic level too quickly or too slowly. Interim dynamics should be used sparingly: their repeated use can look fussy and destroy the impression of a long phrase. Alternatively, add reminders such as cresc./dim. sempre after rests or at the beginning of a new system.

Place interim dynamics in brackets, to indicate their transitional status:

[musical example]

A hairpin may be broken for an interim dynamic. Maintain the same angle for the hairpin either side of the interim dynamic, so that the hairpin is clearly one gradual dynamic change. It is unnecessary in this case to enclose the interim dynamic in brackets since it is clear that the dynamic change continues:

[musical example]

#### Sudden dynamic changes

The term subito ('suddenly'; abbrev. sub.) alerts the performer to an abrupt dynamic change. It also indicates that an interim dynamic change has not been omitted.

Use subito to show when a dynamic is not the logical conclusion of a hairpin:

[musical example]

Place a dynamic exactly under the first note to which it refers, and fit in sub. around the dynamic: usually to the right, so that the placing of the new dynamic is not ambiguous. When a rest precedes the dynamic, sub. may also precede the dynamic:

[musical example]

Where there is not space to include sub., use a vertical stroke or dotted line between each sudden dynamic change:

[musical example]

A dynamic may be followed by a horizontal line to indicate no dynamic change (e.g. when another part does take a change of dynamic). This makes cautionary non cresc./non dim. instructions and the use of subito redundant:

[musical example]

#### Niente

Niente: nothing; dim. al niente: fade to nothing

A small circle at the closed end of a hairpin may be used to indicate growing from, as well as fading to, nothing. The circle is best attached to the hairpin, since a free-floating circle is inconspicuous:

[musical example]

Not every performer will be conversant with this notation, and so it should be clarified with an explanatory note.

#### Repetition of dynamics

In ensemble music, reiterate dynamics after rests, to save the performer looking back for a dynamic while preparing for the next entry. 'Reminder' dynamics may be given in ordinary round brackets (as in the first example under Interim dynamics, above). The brackets indicate an unchanged dynamic. These are useful especially when other performers have different dynamic levels. But it is not helpful to reiterate an unchanged dynamic constantly, since this tends to clutter the music.

A repeated pattern of dynamics should always be written out in full rather than using simile or Sim. (as is customary for repeated articulation: see Repeated articulation, p. 116). The performer will almost certainly forget them completely:

[musical example]

(For sforzando and rinforzando, see Intensity of attack, p. 115.)

## Articulation

### Slurs

The slur has a number of different meanings relating to articulation in addition to its general use as a phrase mark. For the wind player, it is the number of notes not separately tongued (see Articulation, p. 245); for the string player, the number of notes in a bow stroke (see Combined-note bowing, p. 401); for the singer, the number of notes sung to one syllable (see Syllabic slurs, p. 435).

#### Design

The slur is the same tapered arc as the tie, although the tie may have a flatter curve to allow room for slurs and to differentiate the two (see Ties, p. 60). When notes at the beginning and end of a slur are the same pitch, the slur may look identical to a tie because it will, like the tie, be completely symmetrical. When the outer pitches are different, the ends of the slur are at different heights and the slur tilts between the first and last note. Aim for as consistent a curve as possible:

[musical example]

The curve of a long slur is flattened in order to be as close to the stave as possible. In fact, a long slur may be completely flat in the middle, since a rounded one extends too far from the stave:

[musical example]

On a stave, the arc should be placed in a stave-space in order to be most conspicuous:

[musical example]

#### Positioning relative to the stave

When all stems within the slur are in the same direction, the slur is usually placed between the outer noteheads.

When groups of mixed stem direction are encompassed by a slur, place the slur above the stave, except when a beam may be in the way:

[musical example]

Regardless of stem direction, in cramped conditions it may sometimes be best to place a long slur above the stave, to be clear of dynamics:

[musical example]

Slurs for the left-hand stave of a keyboard part may go below the stave to be clear of mid-system dynamics (see Placing slurs, p. 321).

For stemless notes, place the slur as if the notes were stemmed. Slurs for notes on the centre line and chords equidistant from the centre line can go either side, but are usually treated as if the notes had down-stems:

[musical example]

#### Positioning relative to noteheads and stems

**Slurs next to noteheads**

The ends of a slur may be placed as close as half a stave-space from the centre of noteheads, including where ties are placed at the edge of noteheads. Where there is plenty of space, the tie starts and finishes at the centre of noteheads; in this case, the slur must move further from the note, so that its ends can also centre on it:

[musical example]

(See also Placing articulation and slurs with ties, p. 62.)

**Slurs at stem end**

Where other notes or stems will not be obstructed, the slur may move slightly closer to the noteheads, beside the stems, so as to be more conspicuous:

[musical example]

Where staccato and tenuto marks fall within the slur, the slur cannot move towards the noteheads but must remain at the ends of the stems:

[musical example]

(See Placing slurs with other articulation marks, p. 121.)

When outer notes have opposite stem directions, move the slur at the stem end towards the noteheads so it does not tilt contrary to the direction of the pitches:

[musical example]

The slur should not, however, move too close to noteheads if there is room for it to be further away. It should always remain outside a beam:

[musical example]

#### Slurs over a system break

At the end of a system, the slur finishes just short of the last barline, and not beyond it. At the beginning of the new system, the slur starts after the clef, key signature and time signature, but before any accidental. The incomplete slur should look clearly open-ended, or each side of the system break will appear to take a separate slur:

[musical example]

Take all the notes within the slur into account when determining whether the slur goes above or below the stave — do not swap position between systems:

[musical example]

The whole slur should tilt in the direction of the pitches. A slur starting on the last note of a system or finishing on the first note of a system must be angled in the direction of the final pitch on the new system, so as to look clearly open-ended (this differentiates an open-ended slur from an open-ended tie):

[musical example]

**Slur length**

One complete slur should cover a whole phrase, so that its full extent is immediately clear. Do not divide a slur between notes of a phrase, nor around tied notes. In full scores, divided phrase marks are sometimes used in cramped conditions, to save space. These should never be used in performance material, since they obscure the phrase length:

[musical example]

When a final pitch is extended by a series of tied notes, it is acceptable (and a convention) to end the slur with the first whole-bar duration; alternatively, in cramped conditions, with the first tied note:

[musical example]

When an initial note is tied, the slur may begin with the final written tied note if absolutely necessary, to save space; however, it is much better to clarify phrase length by starting the slur with the first note:

[musical example]

**Slurs within slurs**

When two slurs are used simultaneously, the shorter one represents articulation, the longer one the phrase structure. The shorter slur goes closest to the notes:

[musical example]

Note that it is best not to use two sets of slurs in music for wind and strings, since this causes confusion (see also Two-note tremolos: Slurs, p. 228).

**Dotted slurs**

A dotted slur may indicate where a literal legato is not possible, i.e. where individual notes within a phrase are rearticulated:

[musical example]

When a phrase includes rests, a solid slur is equally valid, and visually less fussy:

[musical example]

### Slurs between chords

All notes on one stem take a single slur, and not a slur to each note:

[musical example]

For adjacent-note chords, centre the slur on the notehead that is on the correct side of the stem:

[musical example]

(For combining slurs and ties between chords, see With slurs, p. 71.)

If parts are separately stemmed, each requires its own slurs (see In double-stemmed writing, p. 117).

(See also Placing slurs with other articulation marks, p. 121; for placing slurs with grace notes, see Slurs, p. 129.)

### Articulation marks

#### Definition

Articulation marks are interpreted by their context — the style and period of the music. They have the flexibility to be adapted to different styles; conversely, this can lend them an ambiguity to challenge the interpreter. Since different schools of performance may assume separate interpretations, it can be advisable to state at the beginning of a piece exactly how articulation should be performed, especially if interpretation is to differ from the definition given opposite.

In general, present-day interpretation is as follows:

- strong accent (see also Intensity of attack, below)
- standard accent
- tenuto: separated articulation, or a stress, or a note held for its full duration
- staccato wedge or dash: a heavy staccato (between marcato and staccato), also staccatissimo (see below)
- staccato (abbrev. stacc.)

Staccatissimo (abbrev. staccatiss.) is best indicated verbally together with staccato dots.

The tenuto line implies either holding a note for its full length, or a slight separation from surrounding notes. In combination with a staccato mark it lengthens the note.

#### Intensity of attack

The accent symbols above may be replaced by the following terms:

- sforzando / sforzato ('reinforcing'; both abbrev. sf or sfz) is used for a sudden accent
- rinforzando / rinforzato (abbrev. rf / rfz / rinf.) has the same meaning but is sometimes used for a part (or a passage) that should predominate

These terms can be modified according to the dynamic: at dynamic levels of f they appear as sf or sfz, at ff, they become sff or sffz; and at fff, sfff or sfffz.

#### Stress symbols introduced by Schoenberg

Schoenberg introduced symbols to represent a stressed note and an unstressed note. These symbols function to indicate when stresses contradict the metre (see Cross rhythm, p. 171).

The symbols should be placed above the stave, except in double-stemmed writing, and outside any articulation marks:

[musical example]

#### Repeated articulation

Staccato sempre and rinforzato sempre indicate repeated articulation. It is helpful to notate the articulation in full initially:

[musical example]

Simile (abbrev. Sim.) may replace repeated bars of other articulation marks, and combined marks:

[musical example]

(See also Technical instructions, p. 492; for articulation on repeated-note abbreviations, see Repeated articulation, p. 223.)

#### Symbol design

With the exception of the staccato dot, articulation marks should match the width and height of a notehead, or be slightly larger.

The strong accent: this is thicker on one side than the other. The up-bow symbol, which has two thin diagonal strokes, is not a substitute.

The standard accent: this has lines of equal thickness. It is slightly wider than a notehead, but if it is too wide it may look like a diminuendo hairpin.

The tenuto line: this is thicker than a stave-line so as to be conspicuous. It is the width of a notehead.

The staccato wedge: this sign should be sufficiently bold for it to be easily distinguished from a staccato dot.

The staccato dot: this is smaller than the duration dot.

#### Placing articulation next to noteheads or stems

Articulation goes where it is most conspicuous: to the notehead. Except in double-stemmed writing, never place articulation below down-stems.

[musical example]

(For placing articulation on grace notes, see Articulation, p. 130.)

The strong accent usually goes above the stave, regardless of stem direction, because of the amount of space it occupies. Placing the accent above the stave also avoids its inversion, which, in some contexts, may look like an up-bow symbol in string writing:

[musical example]

When space below the stave is limited, all articulation may be placed above:

[musical example]

**In double-stemmed writing**

Each part requires its own articulation marks (including slurs), even when the two parts have identical articulation and phrasing. This includes unisons:

[musical example]

Place articulation marks at the end of each stem. Articulation should never be placed on the notehead side of a part as it must be clear which marking belongs to which note. Any articulation on the stave is extremely confusing in double-stemmed writing:

[musical example]

Articulation should not move closer to the note than the end of the stem, as this also is confusing:

[musical example]

(See also Placing slurs with other articulation marks, p. 121; also, Sharing stems, p. 525.)

#### Exact positioning beside noteheads and stems

Articulation is centred in line with the notehead, whether positioned next to a notehead or a stem (but see also Staccatos at stem end, below):

[musical example]

Thus, in double-stemmed writing, the articulation aligns vertically between the parts. (Some editions do, however, centre articulation on the stem.)

**Staccatos at stem end**

Staccato dots and wedges by themselves look best centred on a stem and therefore are an exception to the above rule, although many editions do centre them on the notehead. They may move beside the stem in cramped conditions:

[musical example]

When staccato dots or wedges are combined with other articulation marks — which are always centred on the notehead — staccato dots should be centred too:

[musical example]

#### Stemless notes

Place articulation as if the note were stemmed. Notes on the centre line or chords equidistant from the centre line are usually treated as if they had down-stems:

[musical example]

When there are two parts on one stave, articulation for stemless notes moves in close to the noteheads:

#### Adjacent- and unison-note chords

Centre articulation on the notehead that is on the correct side of the stem:

[musical example]

#### Distance from noteheads

Articulation marks are best placed a consistent distance from each notehead, so that the eye can follow them most easily:

[musical example]

#### Articulation on the stave

Place articulation marks no closer than the first clear stave-space from the note.

Centre tenuto lines and staccato dots in a stave-space:

- notes in a space: placed in the space next to the note
- notes on a line: placed in the next clear space

[musical example]

A stave-line must never obscure the articulation:

[musical example]

Accents and staccato wedges are usually best placed outside the stave, where they are most conspicuous. They can move onto the stave when they would otherwise be a long way from the note.

The accent is clearest when centred in a space. As it tends to obscure a pitch when placed in the stave, a series of accents is best placed outside the stave:

[musical example]

The accent and staccato wedge should intersect a stave-line for greatest legibility. The top part of the accent intersects the line so that the white space at the peak shows through:

[musical example]

An additional mark takes a separate stave-space further from the note. Do not cram more than one articulation mark into a stave-space or both become illegible:

[musical example]

When ledger-line notes require articulation between the notehead and the stave, place articulation marks no closer to the notes than the outermost stave-spaces. This ensures that articulation does not collide nor obscure ledger lines:

[musical example]

Tenuto lines should be even further from ledger lines so that the eye does not confuse the two. When there are several notes on ledger lines, tenuto lines are best placed at the stem ends of up-stemmed notes, for clarity:

[musical example]

#### Distance from stems

Within the stave, place articulation marks in the first clear stave-space beyond the end of the stem. Articulation outside the stave should be about half a stave-space from each stem.

Only staccato dots and wedges may fall within the length of the stem (see Staccatos at stem end, above).

#### Placing slurs with other articulation marks

The smallest signs go closest to the notehead:

- notehead side: [musical example]
- stem side: [musical example]

The staccato wedge is placed in the same position as the staccato dot.

Usually, only tenuto lines and staccato marks may go inside the first and last notes of a slur:

[musical example]

(See also Interpreting tenuto and staccato marks at ends of slurs, p. 122.)

Articulation marks in the middle of a slur go inside the slur. Accents at the beginning and end of a slur usually go outside the slur, so that the slur can remain closer to the noteheads:

[musical example]

An exception is when they would otherwise be too far from a note to be immediately apparent:

[musical example]

When notes within a slur have mixed stem direction, place articulation marks beside each notehead, even though the slur is above the stave:

[musical example]

Centre a slur on a stem. With the addition of a tenuto line between the slur and a stem, centre the slur, like the tenuto line, on the notehead (when there is a staccato dot, the slur centres on the stem):

[musical example]

#### Interpreting tenuto and staccato marks at ends of slurs

To show a slur between two consecutive notes of the same pitch, place articulation between slur and noteheads:

[musical example]

When articulation is placed outside the slur on either or both of the two notes, the slur becomes a tie:

[musical example]
