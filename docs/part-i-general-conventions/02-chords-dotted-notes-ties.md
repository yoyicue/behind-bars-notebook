# 2. Chords – Dotted Notes – Ties

## Chords

### Single–stemmed Chords

Two or more notes of the same duration are combined onto one stem to form a chord:

[musical example]

Notes of different duration can be combined onto one stem for a chord only in string writing:

[musical example]

This is because the bow can sustain only two notes at once (see Triple- and quadruple–stopping, p. 398).

In all other cases, notes of different duration must take separate stems. The upper part takes up-stems, and the lower part takes down–stems (see Double–stemmed writing, p. 52):

[musical example]

#### Stem direction

The notehead furthest away from the centre of the stave determines the stem direction. When this note is above the middle line, the chord takes a down–stem; when the note is below the middle line, the chord takes an up–stem:

[musical example]

Stems joining noteheads that are equidistant from the centre of the stave can go in either direction, although many editions use only down–stems:

[musical example]

As with stem direction of single notes (see Stem direction, p. 13), the direction may be determined by context. The aim is to achieve a consistent stem direction within a phrase, bar or half–bar:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

#### Chords with three or more notes

The stem direction is still determined by whichever of the chord's outer notes is furthest from the centre of the stave:

[musical example]

Where the outer notes are equidistant from the centre of the stave, stem direction is determined by the position of the majority of notes. When the majority is above the middle stave-line, the chord takes a down stem; when the majority is below the middle line, the chord takes an up–stem:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

The following chords have all notes equidistant from the centre of the stave and so can take either stem direction:

[musical example]

### Adjacent–note Chords

#### Single stems

##### Two adjacent notes

To write intervals a second apart, place the lower note on the left-hand side of the stem, the upper note on the right-hand side:

[musical example]

Adjacent-note chords slope diagonally from bottom left to top right, even when this means a repeated note changes stem-side from chord to chord:

[musical example]

##### More than two adjacent notes

The majority of notes fall on the 'correct' side of the stem. Thus when there are an odd number of notes, the lowest note goes on the left–hand side for up-stems, and on the right-hand side for down-stems:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

When there is an even number of notes, the lowest note always goes on the left-hand side of the stem:

[musical example]

The French system of placing the highest and lowest notes on the 'correct' side of the stem should not be followed, since often this forces the lower of two adjacent notes to the right (rather than to the left) side of the stem:

[musical example]

correct layout

[musical example]

French system

[musical example]

#### Double stems

Arrange chords so that notes on the 'correct' side of each stem align vertically:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

(This same principle should be used to align adjacent–note chords in a score — see Vertical alignment, p. 490.)

The only exception is when a tone or semitone separates the two parts. In this case, the lower part is displaced to the right (if the parts are vertically aligned, it is hard to tell which note belongs to which part):

[musical example]

not

[musical example]

(See also Offsetting unison and adjacent noteheads, p. 53.)

### Stemless notes

Stemless noteheads are arranged as if they were stemmed:

[musical example]

#### Chords with single-stemmed unison notes

##### Perfect unisons

Place one notehead each side of the stem:

[musical example]

(For Dotted unisons, see p. 58.)

##### Altered unisons

Place each notehead after its own accidental in ascending chromatic order (flat to sharp).

Usually a note is displaced to the right of a chord, and joined to the vertical stem by a diagonal one. Position the diagonal so as to avoid cutting through (and thereby obscuring) the second accidental:

[musical example]

alignment with another part

[musical example]

Extend the vertical stem beyond the point where the diagonal joins it. Any tails or beams should be clear of the diagonal stem:

[musical example]

not

[musical example]

Occasionally, it is more convenient to displace a note before the rest of the chord, for example when there is more space available before rather than after the chord. Another part would align with the stem:

[musical example]

A two–note chord can, alternatively, splay out from the vertical stem in both directions, using a branching stem:

[musical example]

alignment with another part

[musical example]

In very cramped conditions, it is acceptable to place one notehead each side of the stem with both accidentals before both notes. This notation is compact but much less clear, since an accidental is always best placed beside the notehead to which it applies. If this layout is used, both notes must have accidentals, or the two pitches will appear to be the same. The order of accidentals for a chord containing a sharp and a natural sign is #♮, since ♮ might appear to be a sharp cancelling a double–sharp sign:

[musical example]

An accidental must never be placed after the note to which it refers, since a note cannot be modified once it has been sounded:

[musical example]

(See also Accidentals in double-stemmed writing: Altered unisons, p. 91.)

#### In a note cluster

All noteheads must be attached to a stem so that they are immediately identified as part of the chord. It is not enough that a notehead touches another notehead:

[musical example]

A square bracket should encompass simultaneous notes. Align another part with the first notehead, or otherwise where the stem of an adjacent–note chord would be:

[musical example]

(See also Keyboard: Note clusters, p. 326.)

### Double–stemmed writing

The upper part always takes up-stems, the lower part down–stems, even when pitches overlap (see Overlapping parts, p. 53).

#### Unisons

Two parts with the same note–Value may share a notehead as long as they take two stems:

[musical example]

Notes without stems take a separate notehead for each part:

[musical example]

A black notehead can be shared by any black–note durations:

[musical example]

Semibreves, minims and black noteheads should be kept separate from each other:

[musical example]

(See also Dotted unisons, p. 58; for keyboard–writing conventions, see Sharing noteheads in unison, p. 307.)

#### Offsetting unison and adjacent noteheads

Offset the lower part to the right. Vertically align the upper part with a part on another stave:

unison notes

[musical example]

adjacent notes

[musical example]

Exceptions to this rule occur when parts overlap (see below; also, Overlapping parts, p. 57); and when double–stemmed adjacent or unison notes have only one dotted part (see Adjacent notes, p. 56, and Dotted unisons: One part dotted, p. 59).

Keep noteheads separate; stems should not touch. Semibreves in particular should not appear to be joined to stems:

unison notes

[musical example]

adjacent notes

[musical example]

Some editions reverse the order of noteheads so that the semibreve is never adjacent to a stem. The part on the left aligns vertically with a part on another stave (this is the case whichever the notehead arrangement):

[musical example]

unison notes

[musical example]

adjacent notes

[musical example]

#### Overlapping parts

Place a down-stemmed part to the left so that noteheads can overlap. Slightly separate the parts so that the stems do not appear to include both notes. As with adjacent and unison noteheads, it is the part on the left that aligns with a part on another stave:

[musical example]

not

[musical example]

This is more compact than the following:

[musical example]

Place a down–stemmed part to the left for overlapping adjacent notes:

[musical example]

Overlapping semibreves must be divided into stemmed notes in order to show part progression:

[musical example]

(For arrangement with ledger–line notes, see Double-stemmed adjacent notes and overlapping parts, p. 27.)

## Dotted Notes

Most traditional engraving uses a duration dot that is larger than a staccato dot — often twice the size.

### Placing dots relative to noteheads

Place the dot close to its notehead so that it can be spotted immediately — usually a half stave–space's distance.

Double and triple dots should be placed close together and evenly spaced:

[musical example]

When notes are in a space, place the dot in the middle of that space. When notes are on a line, place the dot in the space above:

[musical example]

(See also Double stems, p. 56.)

Dotted notes on ledger lines follow the same principle. The dot moves above the ledger line when the note is on a line:

[musical example]

but not

[musical example]

Upstemmed notes with tails: should the end of a tail coincide with the position of the dot and thereby obscure it, it is acceptable to move the dot to the right of the tail:

[musical example]

It is equally acceptable to lengthen the stem.

[musical example]

Chords

Every notehead in a chord must take a duration dot. Vertically align the dots after the chord:

[musical example]

#### Adjacent-note chords

When the upper note is on a line, the dot moves up into the next stave–space, as usual. When the lower note is on a line, the dot drops to the lower space:

[musical example]

Each dot should always have a stave–space to itself. This same spacing applies to chords on ledger lines as well, where dots should not be bunched up just because there are no stave lines to separate them into individual spaces (see following example).

A dot may need to move a stave–space away from its notehead. Do not align the dots horizontally, as this gives double-dotted value to the notes:

[musical example]

Centre the dots on the chord, rather than placing them in one direction, away from the chord:

[musical example]

When a dot is forced to be two or more stave-spaces from the chord, its function becomes less relevant. In such cases, use only as many dots as cover the number of stave-spaces taken up by the chord:

[musical example]

#### Double stems

##### Lower part on a line

Drop the dot into the space below the lower part:

[musical example]

When the voices are close together, this avoids ambiguity as to which part the dot belongs:

not

[musical example]

Both parts dotted: the upper dot is usually aligned with the lower dot after both parts (this layout is most compact), although it is acceptable to place each dot closer to each notehead:

Adjacent notes

[musical example]

recommended

[musical example]

acceptable

[musical example]

One part dotted: each dot is placed next to its notehead, even though this may force a gap between the parts (see bar 1); a dot should not be separated from its notehead by the adjacent note:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

When the upper part is on a line, the upper dot may be placed above the lower notehead (see previous example, bar 2). However, so that the duration dot does not look like a staccato marking for the lower part, some editions place dotted upper notes to the right. Thus the dot is clear of both parts:

[musical example]

(See also Overlapping adjacent notes, below.)

#### Chords with adjacent notes

Align dots vertically for each part, independently of other chords:

[musical example]

#### Overlapping parts

Where only one part is dotted, do not separate a dot from its notehead by placing a stem in between:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

Where both parts are dotted and conditions are cramped, the layout is more compact if both dots follow both notes:

in cramped conditions

[musical example]

#### Overlapping adjacent notes

Both parts dotted: the parts may overlap:

[musical example]

One part dotted: the parts should not overlap. Place a dotted up-stemmed part to the left and separate the parts with the dot. If the up–stemmed part goes to the right, it will look as if the down–stemmed part takes the dot:

[musical example]

For a dotted down-stemmed part on a line, the dot is forced into the space above, to be clear of the up-stemmed part:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

#### Overlapping chords

Place the dots beside each chord so that they are not separated from their noteheads by the other part, unless space is limited:

in cramped conditions

[musical example]

#### Dotted unisons

##### Single stems

Each notehead requires a dot. Each dot must have a separate stave–space, even though the noteheads are in the same space or on the same line; they will otherwise appear to be double-dotted:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

It is best to place the dots after each notehead (they are most visible in this arrangement) except in cramped conditions:

[musical example]

in cramped conditions

[musical example]

##### Double stems

###### Both parts dotted

A double-stemmed unison that has one notehead requires only one dot:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

However, the unison semibreve requires two noteheads and therefore each notehead should take a dot:

[musical example]

Unless conditions are cramped, notes of different duration take a dot beside each notehead:

[musical example]

in cramped conditions

[musical example]

###### One part dotted

It is acceptable for the dotted note to share a notehead with a note without a dot as long as the rhythm of both parts is absolutely clear:

[musical example]

(This is a useful convention for repeated patterns in keyboard music — see Sharing noteheads in unison, p. 307.)

Should the rhythms appear ambiguous (the example above may well be considered inadequate), use separate noteheads as this will always be the clearest arrangement:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

The normal arrangement is to place the upper part to the left:

[musical example]

However, there are two other equally valid approaches.

The first approach is to place the part without the dot first, to the left, so that the notes can close up. The reader infers that the dot applies to only the right–hand part, because otherwise the two parts would share the same notehead:

[musical example]

The other approach is to clarify that only one part is dotted by placing the dotted value first. Thus the dot separates the two noteheads:

[musical example]

On ledger lines: when the part placed first is dotted, separate the ledger lines. The ledger lines are not separated when only the second part takes a dot:

[musical example]

## Ties

The function of a tie is to show the absence of rearticulation.

### Tie design

The design of the tie, the curve and the gradation of the line, is a distinctive component of the appearance of the music.

A tie is a tapered arc, symmetrical in shape, which extends between two noteheads of identical pitch. Two enharmonically equivalent pitches may also be joined by a tie:

[musical example]

Square brackets should not be used as ties.

The tie and slur (phrase mark) have the same design, although ties tend to have a flatter arc, to allow room for slurs and to differentiate the two.

The tie extends from notehead to notehead: if one or both ends point to a stem, the arc becomes a slur:

[musical example]

The tie should almost touch each notehead. An arc further away from the noteheads may be taken for a slur:

[musical example]

(See Slurs, p. 109.)

#### Curve of the tie

The curve of the tie should be sufficiently round to be conspicuous through a stave–line. Ideally, a shallow tie is 1–1½ stave-spaces deep.

The centre of the curve should not coincide with a stave–line, since the tie then becomes less conspicuous. This means that ties drawn within the stave will usually cut through a stave-line:

[musical example]

Ties are generally confined within one stave–space when they are very short, and when they must be flattened to avoid another part:

[musical example]

Should it be impossible to add a tie without obscuring a notehead, a tie may be divided (see example Dividing ties, p. 133).

The curve of a long tie is flattened to prevent excessively variable curve heights between ties:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

Note that when chords have stems with tails (as above), it is best to lengthen the stem to avoid tails and ties colliding.

[musical example]

#### Positioning ends of tie relative to notehead

The exact position of the ends of a tie may vary according to surrounding notation.

Where there is plenty of space and no articulation to implement, the tie starts and finishes at the centre of the notehead:

[musical example]

Where the tie needs to be brought closer to the notehead (e.g. to allow space for articulation), the ends of the tie align with the edge of the notehead:

[musical example]

(See also Placing articulation and slurs with ties, below.)

The tie may start slightly after and finish slightly before the notehead. When notes are in spaces, this enables the ends of a tie to be brought into the same space as the notehead:

[musical example]

Such positioning is often necessary for tied chords (see Placing ties on Chords, opposite). Make ties between tightly spaced notes as long as possible, in order to have them most conspicuous:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

##### Placing articulation and slurs with ties

So that a tie does not collide with articulation or slurs, the ends of the tie align with the edge of the notehead (a) or else start slightly after and finish slightly before the notehead (b):

[musical example]

#### A tie intersecting a stem

A tie intersects a stem only under exceptional circumstances, e.g. when two parts overlap (see Overlapping parts, p. 67). In all other circumstances the tie should fall short of the following stem:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

#### Placing ties on chords

##### Multiple-note chords

Inner ties must start after and finish before each notehead. Outer ties may be drawn parallel to this, so that all ties are the same length (a). It is equally acceptable for the outer ties to be full length (b):

[musical example]

For close-position chords, it is best if ties start in the same stave–space as the notehead, so that they are clearly seen to be attached to the correct note:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

##### Adjacent-note chords

It is usually clearer to start each tie close to each notehead, rather than to align all ties after all notes:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

(See also Tied unisons, p. 69.)

##### Placing ties with dotted notes

###### Single notes

Place the dot within the tie — the tie does not follow the dot. Curve the tie sufficiently to avoid obscuring the dot:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

###### Chords

Position ties so that no dot is obscured.

Ties may start immediately after each notehead, in between the duration dots, as long as they will fit without colliding: (a) and not (d). Otherwise inner ties should start after the dots (b). Ties for outer notes may follow the position of inner ties if preferred, but this may place these ties rather far from their noteheads (c):

[musical example]

#### Tie direction for single notes

##### Stems in one direction

A tie curves away from the stems of the notes:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

A tie between stemless notes behaves as if stems were present:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

##### Consecutive stems in opposite directions

Ties curve away from the middle stave-line:

[musical example]

To curve all ties upwards for notes below the middle line, as some editions do, creates a collision between a tie and the tail of an up–stemmed first note:

[musical example]

(However, this may be unavoidable in double-stemmed writing — see p. 67.)

#### Tie direction for single–stemmed chords

Two notes on a stem: the ties curve in opposite directions:

[musical example]

An even number of ties: equal numbers of ties curve in each direction:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

An odd number of ties: the majority of ties curve away from the stem:

[musical example]

Some editions tie middle notes of both odd– and even-note chords according to their position on the stave. Ties for notes on and above the middle stave–line curve upwards, ties for notes below the middle line curve downwards:

not recommended

[musical example]

#### Distance apart of ties

Place ties that are in the same direction a minimum of one stave-space apart. This applies to ties both on and outside the stave. One tie per stave–space prevents the ties from obscuring stave–lines or merging together:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

##### On ledger lines

Either flatten the ties (a) or move them horizontally further from the noteheads (b) in order to avoid them touching ledger lines (c):

[musical example]

but not

[musical example]

#### Adjacent notes

Adjacent-note ties are curved away from each other. This avoids two ties close together curving in the same direction. The adjacent notes dictate the direction of all other ties in the chord, overruling the usual tie–direction conventions for the rest of the chord:

[musical example]

Pairs of adjacent notes: each pair may take opposite tie directions as long as the middle ties do not collide nor overlap:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

Consecutive adjacent notes: curve parallel ties in both directions away from the middle of the chord. Position the ties outwards from the centre of the chord, one per stave-space. Each tied note must have a tie; therefore the ties at the edges of the chord will be progressively further away vertically from the notes to which they refer:

[musical example]

#### Tie direction in double–stemmed writing

The upper part takes upward-curving ties, the lower part downward–curving ties:

[musical example]

This applies to all the notes on one stem:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

##### Overlapping parts

One part tied: when the parts are not tied simultaneously, the ties curve towards their stems as normal:

[musical example]

Where possible, place the parts so that a stem does not come between a note and its tie. This may involve reversing the usual arrangement of parts (marked * ):

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

Both parts tied: ties may curve away from their stems if necessary, so that they are clear of each other:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

One tie should never intersect another, since this is visually confusing: either reverse normal tie direction (as above) or else divide up the tie (see first example under With ledger lines, p. 68).

Note that the tie may cut through the stem of the other part (as in the previous example), rather than curve a long way from the notehead, which makes the tie look too similar to a slur:

[musical example]

A stem should not end at the point it meets the tie. Either shorten or lengthen the stem. A tie may cut through the stems of a beamed group as long as the tie is sufficiently curved and does not look like another beam (bars 1–2):

[musical example]

(See also extract from Carter's Syringa, p. 382.)

##### With ledger lines

A tie should not pass between ledger lines. A tie by nature should be kept as flat as possible, to distinguish it from a slur. Therefore it is sometimes clearest to break the tie:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

When a tie is not required to overlap with another, it is clearest not to break it. It may be moved further from the notes while being kept reasonably flat (a). When the curve of the tie is too rounded, it looks too much like a slur (b):

[musical example]

Whether or not the parts overlap, never allow a tie to intersect the other part's ledger lines (see first example on p. 306, (b)).

#### Tied unisons

##### Single stems

Perfect unisons

Each notehead requires its own tie.

The ties should point to and from each notehead, with the upper tie for the note on the left and the lower tie for the note on the right:

[musical example]

A stem should not intersect a tie:

[musical example]

Ties must not overlap nor cross; it is better to point the ties to the 'wrong' notehead:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

Altered unisons

Each tie should be drawn between its own noteheads:

[musical example]

##### Double stems

Each part must have its own tie, even though there is only one notehead and one duration dot:

[musical example]

A single tie indicates that only one part is tied; however, when this is the case, it is clearest to use two noteheads:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

When the parts have different durations, it is acceptable to reverse the order of noteheads so that a notehead can be nearer its tie:

[musical example]

When one part is also dotted, the part with the dot may go to the right, so that the notes can close up:

[musical example]

#### Tie direction for single–stemmed moving chords

For clarity, a moving part usually takes a separate stem, but where this is not possible, tied and untied notes may appear on the same stem. To draw attention to a note–change in a chord, curve ties away from an added or released note:

[musical example]

adding notes

[musical example]

releasing notes

[musical example]

When one note is added whilst another is released on alternate sides of a tied note, obviously the tie direction cannot be curved away from both. Usually the tie is curved away from a note added for the second chord:

[musical example]

The tie can be reversed away from the added note if it would otherwise be unclear which note was tied:

[musical example]

A passage of such chords looks clearest when all ties are placed in one direction:

[musical example]

rather than

[musical example]

Ties are placed conventionally when notes are added or released simultaneously above and below the tied note:

[musical example]

Curve a tie away from an added note with an accidental, so that the two do not collide:

[musical example]

With slurs

When a slur connects chords, place ties and slurs in opposite directions so as to be clearly distinguishable from one another:

[musical example]

Chords tied without a change of pitch

The ties for unchanging chords revert to their conventional positions (marked i):

[musical example]

(To position ties between staves in keyboard writing, see Ties between staves, p. 308; see also Arpeggiated chords notated as consecutive pitches, p. 133; for use of ties with tremolos, see Ties, p. 225.)

#### Open ties

A short, open (or 'incomplete') tie is used to show that a note is sustained beyond its written duration. This is also indicated laissez vibrer (see below).

A long tie extending to a rest or barline indicates that a note should be held for its full length:

[musical example]

A short open-ended tie extending from the notehead is used in some French editions to replace the longer complete tie. This should not be used, as it does not show the progression of the tied note sufficiently clearly:

[musical example]

Such ties should be used only where no other solution is practical (see Janáček extract, p. 550).

Laissez vibrer

(French, 'leave to Vibrate', Italian: lasciar vibrare; abbrev. l.v.)

This is an instruction not to damp an instrument that has natural sustaining resonance. The instruction applies to sounds that are sustained naturally by an instrument, not held manually, and which are not to be damped until indicated (if at all).

The instruction l.v. sempre specifies that no notes in a passage are to be damped.

The initial note is best written as a single note–Value, as this is easiest to read; l.v. is written after the note. This may be accompanied by an open tie, although l.v. or a tie alone is sufficient:

[musical example]

The instruction l.v. al niente indicates that the sound should be allowed to die away to nothing

When a sound is to be damped later on, the continuing resonance is indicated with open ties over or after subsequent barlines (but see also Notes sustained with a pedal, opposite). Add rests to make up the value of incomplete bars (see bar 4). Rests may be omitted for whole bars, but are best added for completeness:

[musical example]

Rests may be divided up to show a damping or pedal release point in the middle of a bar (as above).

It is better not to indicate the termination (release) point with a tied note–Value, unless all durations are written in full, since at a quick glance it may look as if the sound should be re–articulated:

[musical example]

incorrect

[musical example]

### Notes sustained with a pedal

Instruments that can sustain notes with pedals (piano, celesta, vibraphone) do not require l.v. ties for notes that are sustained in this way, since pedal markings must be indicated in any case. Once a note is struck, the sound will be sustained until the pedal is released. Continued notation of the sustained notes for the duration of the pedal is unnecessarily complicated:

[musical example]

and not

[musical example]

(For exceptions in piano writing, see Notes sustained with a pedal, p. 337; for l.v. percussion notation, see Long-reverberating instruments, p. 289; for harp, see Laissez vibrer, p. 363; for guitar, see Sustaining and damping, p. 383.)
