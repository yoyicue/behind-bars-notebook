# 6. Metre

## Introduction

### Barring for practicality

Notated metre represents a pattern of accented and unaccented beats within
a bar. For some composers the implied hierarchy of accent within metre is
not relevant and they use barring solely for convenience: for the practical
purposes of conducting, for co-ordination in unconducted music and to
facilitate reading rhythm in manageable bar lengths. Accents are notated
where they are required, but otherwise the beginning and subdivisions of the
bar are not intended to be stressed. Such scores should indicate that barlines
are for co-ordination only and have no function as metric accentuation. Ligeti
notes this in some of his scores (see, for example, the Chamber Concerto and
Ramifications).

### Barring for metrical purposes

Composers for whom the hierarchy of accent is relevant will select one time
signature in preference to another to determine the placing of such implied
accents. For example, 4/4, 6/8 and 12/16 are of equal bar length (twelve semi-
quavers) but 4/4 has three stresses, 6/8 has two stresses, 12/16 has four stresses:

[musical example]

A time signature will be associated with its specific beat stresses unless the
musical content contradicts them (see Cross rhythm, p. 171).

Rhythms, including rests, are specifically grouped so that the eye can identify
where the beats of the bar fall (see Beaming according to the metre, p. 153,
Grouping inner beams, p. 156, and Grouping rests according to the metre, p. 160).

## Time signatures

### Definition

The upper figure of the time signature, the numerator, shows the number of
note-values contained in the bar as expressed by the lower figure. The lower
figure, the denominator, is the number of those note-values that, together,
add up to a semibreve (thus 3/4 = 3 crotchets in a bar, 6/8 = 6 quavers in a bar).
In other words, the denominator is the division of the semibreve into equal parts:

[musical example]

(See also Denominator as any division of the semibreve, p. 180.)

### Size and placing

Time-signature numerals should exactly fill the height of the stave. Smaller
numerals are not sufficiently conspicuous:
[musical example]

Time-signature numerals use a unique heavy font so that they stand out as
clearly as possible against the stave. The font distinguishes them from other
numerals so that the eye identifies them instantly.

[musical example]

At the beginning of a piece, the time signature goes after a clef and any key
signature. It holds good for a whole movement or up to a change of metre. It
should be repeated at the beginning of a new movement, even if this is the
same as that of the previous movement, and even when the music follows on
from the previous movement without a break (see Layout between movements,
p. 486).

### Placing time-signature changes

The new time signature is always placed after the barline.

When a change of time signature occurs between systems, add a cautionary
indication at the end of the first system, after the last barline:

[musical example]

A thin double barline precedes a change of time signature only when one
coincides with a new musical section.

(For part preparation, see Time signatures, p. 563; for score layout, see Enlarging time-signature symbols, p. 519.)

## Beaming according to the metre

Divisions of a beat are beamed together in all metres, in order to simplify
reading beats:

metres of 2 beats
[musical example]

metres of 3 beats
[musical example]

metres of 4 beats
[musical example]

In 2/4 and in 3/4, any number of quavers can be beamed together:

[musical example]

This is provided that groups in 2/4 do not give the appearance of 6/8 accentuation. For example, the following common figurations should be notated thus:

[musical example]

The second example incorrectly implies 6/8 accentuation. (Music from the
Classical and Romantic periods frequently uses this beaming — the context
makes it clear that cross rhythm is not intended.)

(See also Dividing notes in three-beat and compound-time metres, p. 168.)

In 4/4 and in 2/2, groups of semiquavers and quavers respectively may be
beamed into half-bars:

[musical example]

However, notes should never be beamed over the middle of the bar, since the
third beat carries a secondary stress which should always be indicated in the
notation:

[musical example]

If in doubt — and for utmost clarity — beam together only the notes of a single
beat. In the following example the quavers in 2/4 are beamed into single beats
to make clear the different accentuation from the 6/8 dotted-crotchet beat:

[musical example]

Beams joining two or three beats may also be separated to indicate a change
of pitch pattern:
[musical example]

Beaming must not obscure bar division in any metre (see Table 1, opposite;
see also Metres of variable stress, p. 178).

### QUAVER-BEAT METRES

It is acceptable to beam together groups of two and three quavers, provided
that inner beams are divided to indicate the quaver beats:

[musical example]

### SEMIQUAVER-BEAT METRES

Groups of two or three beats may be joined together, provided that the innermost beam is divided to indicate the semiquaver beats (semiquaver beams
must join semiquaver beats):

[musical example]

(See also Grouping inner beams, p. 156.)

### COMPOUND TIME

Beams join notes within a beat, never across a beat. The dotted lines in Table 1
(opposite) show this.

6/4 is a compound-time metre (J. + J.). It is sometimes used in alternation
with crotchet metres (3/4 etc.) to mean 3/2 (J + J + J) in order to indicate a continuing crotchet beat. Although not strictly correct, this convention is permissible — as long as the accentuation of the bar is clarified by correct
grouping of both note-values and rests.

### TABLE 1: Beaming according to the metre
Beams must not cross the indicated vertical dotted lines.
The boxes contain the notated duration of a whole bar for the given time signatures on that line.

[musical example]

## Grouping inner beams

Groups of notes are clearest to read when they are subdivided into small units.

In crotchet and dotted-crotchet metres, separate inner beams into quaver units:

[musical example]

This is much easier to read than when the beams are undivided:

not recommended
[musical example]

Groups of semiquavers are not usually separated into quaver units:

[musical example]

except in a dotted-crotchet metre that follows on from a dissimilar beat
division:

[musical example]

In 4/4, groups of semiquavers (or shorter note-values) must be separated into
quaver units since this is a three-beat metre:

[musical example]

### SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN A QUAVER UNIT

For clarity, groups of short note-values should divide into semiquaver
units:

duration
[musical example]

The number of beams separating the groups is equal to the duration of the
groups they separate:

[musical example]

In other words, semiquaver beams must join groups that add up to the value
of a semiquaver — it is incorrect for only a quaver beam to do this:

quaver beams incorrect

[musical example]

### SCALE PASSAGES

It is acceptable for beams to remain undivided, to show that there should be
no internal stresses (although the rhythm will be harder to read when there
are, say, twelve or more notes):

[musical example]

(See also Beaming to reflect musical structure, p. 169.)

## Fractional beams

A note-value that is only a fraction of a beat takes a fractional beam. This
beam points in the direction of the beat or division of the beat to which it
belongs:

[musical example]

(For fractional beam design, see p. 17.)

In 4/4 and in compound-time dotted-crotchet metres (eg. 6/8), a fractional
beam that is part of a second quaver must point in the direction of the
second quaver:

[musical example]

Reversing the beam indicates that the semiquaver belongs to a dotted-quaver beat:

[musical example]

Fractional beams point away from a rest so as to stay inside the main beam.
They should remain separate from their neighbouring inner beams in order
to show that they are a fraction of a beat only:

[musical example]

It is equally acceptable to point beams towards the rests, to clarify the metrical
grouping:
[musical example]

Alternatively, beams may be extended across rests, to occupy whole beats
(see Extending beams to cover whole beats, p. 165).

## Beamed groups indicating variation in speed

A group with fanned beams indicates free accelerando or rallentando within
the duration of a group of notes.

The group uses two or three beams at its fastest point; the beams converge at
the slowest point:
[musical example]

Such beams may extend across a barline:

[musical example]

If it is necessary to indicate the duration of the group, place a small note-value over the group, enclosed within a square bracket:

[musical example]

The notes of the group may either be spaced evenly (as in (a), above), or else
spaced proportionally to their speed: i.e. the slower notes are spaced further
apart than the faster ones ((b) and (c), above).

## Horizontal position of rests

Position a rest exactly as if it were a note of the equivalent duration:

equivalent note-values [musical example]

correct rest placing [musical example]

A rest is always placed at the start of its duration, never in the centre of a beat:

[musical example]

The only exception is for whole-bar rests (see below).

When another part contains grace notes, rests align with the measured note:
[musical example]

(For placing rests on and around the stave, see Vertical placing of rests within
the stave, p. 35.)

### Whole-bar rests

The semibreve rest is placed at the visual centre of the bar, or immediately to
the left of a central duration. When the bar has evenly spaced beats, the rest
will come just before the middle note-value:

[musical example]

Even when the middle rhythmic point is far off-centre, the whole-bar rest
goes at the visual centre of the bar:

[musical example]

When the rest bar contains a clef, key signature or time signature, place the
rest at the centre of the remaining blank space:

[musical example]

The semibreve rest acts as a whole-bar rest in any time signature (but see
below). For all time signatures of 4/4 or 4/2 and over, the breve rest represents
a whole-bar rest:

[musical example]

Place a semibreve rest at the beginning of its duration when it represents the
sum of four crotchet rests, e.g. for a half-bar of 4/4.

### ALTERNATIVE NOTATION: RESTS TAILORED TO THE METRE

The value of the actual rest in the respective time signature may be used on
a one-off or occasional basis. For example, in music of rhythmically complex
and constantly changing metres, this may help a performer to read at speed:

[musical example]

Align each rest as if it were its equivalent note-value:

[musical example]

(See also Metres of variable stress, p. 178.)

When the metrical patterns are not complex, this notation tends to look
unnecessarily fussy. The established convention of using semibreves for all
rests means that they are automatically read in combination with a time
signature, making rest symbols for individual bar lengths redundant.

## Grouping rests according to the metre

Rests must be grouped to clarify the divisions of the bar. Rests with the duration of one or more beats may start only on a beat.

Rests in metres of two and four beats divide to expose the middle of the bar
(marked by dotted lines):

[musical example]

The rests marked |–| , above, may be amalgamated (see Compound Time, p. 163).

simple time

[musical example]

compound time

[musical example]

In metres of three beats, rests must show all beats (a two-beat rest belongs to
a metre of two or four beats):

[musical example]

### Dotted rests

Older editions do not use dotted rests:

[musical example]

However, beats are more compact and thus easier to read when rests within
a beat are combined:

[musical example]

### SIMPLE TIME

Rests at the beginning and end of beats: the recommended practice is to use
dotted rests at the beginning but not at the end of a beat. This visually
identifies on which part of the beat the rests fall:

[musical example]

It is acceptable to use dotted rests at both the beginning and the end of a beat,
although the visual difference between the types of rest is lost:

[musical example]

The longest permitted dotted rest is one value smaller than the beat. In
crotchet metres, the longest dotted rest is a dotted quaver:

[musical example]

(See also Double-dotted rests, below.)

In minim metres, the longest dotted rest is a dotted crotchet:

[musical example]

The dotted-minim rest is normally never used in simple time. The only
exception is to show units of three crotchets in time signatures such as 5/4 and
also 7/4 (see Metres of variable stress, p. 178).

Double-dotted rests: these may replace two or more rests within a beat:

[musical example]

When it is useful to differentiate rests before and after a beat, use the double
dotting only at the beginning of a beat:

[musical example]

When it is preferable to show more clearly how the beat is divided, divide
the rest into half-beats:

[musical example] or [musical example]

Rests in the middle of a beat: these should expose the middle of a beat:

[musical example] or [musical example]

but may be combined when rhythms are straightforward:

[musical example]

### COMPOUND TIME

The dotted rest as a whole beat differentiates compound- from simple-time
metres.

Whole beats may be combined as long as the rests do not obscure the
important divisions of the bar (shown by the dotted lines in Table 1, p. 155).
Otherwise, no rest should be written across a beat:

[musical example]

Rests within a beat: rests at the beginning of a beat may be combined:

[musical example]

When there are alternative ways of combining rests, it is better to indicate
the second rather than the third division of the beat, since this clarifies the
divisions more quickly:

[musical example]

(This same principle applies to note divisions: see Dividing notes in three-beat
and compound-time metres, p. 168.)

Rests that follow a beat should expose all three divisions:

[musical example]

If it is important for a performer to sense all three divisions of an accompanying part, rests at the beginning of the beat should show these:

[musical example]

Otherwise it is better to combine the rests, as this clarifies the position of
beats, especially in long bars:

[musical example]

In the middle of a beat, rests must expose at least two of the three divisions.
Indicate all three divisions if this is important to the musical sense:

[musical example]

## Beaming across rests

It is helpful to beam notes across rests within the beat in order to identify the
position of the beats easily. Beats containing rests are grouped in the same
way as if the rests were equivalent note-values (see Beaming according to the
metre, p. 153).

It is very useful to beam together each beat in compound time:

[musical example]

as this is much quicker to read than separate stems:

[musical example]

When there are repeated rhythmic patterns of quavers in a crotchet metre,
any number of quavers may be beamed together in 2/4 and 3/4:

[musical example]

and half-bars beamed together in 4/4:
[musical example]

Rhythmic figures that are not part of a repeated pattern may be best beamed
into separate beats, so that they are not mistaken for triplets nor for groups
of three quavers in compound time:

[musical example]

### DIVIDING INNER BEAMS FOR RESTS

Inner beams may remain unbroken if equivalent note-values would have
unbroken beams:

[musical example]

However, except for the above patterns of alternating notes and rests, inner
beams look more elegant separated by the rests:

[musical example]

rather

[musical example]

(For positioning rests with beams, see Beams across rests, p. 36.)

### Extending beams to cover whole beats

Beams may extend across rests that start or finish a beat, in order to clarify
the position of a beat. Stemlets (stems that stop short of the rest) mark the
position of each rest, and inner beams are then extended or attached to these
stemlets.

This notation is helpful for passages of complex rhythms, especially where
rests occupy the start or finish of a subdivision of a beat, since the extended
beams then identify the subdivisions:

[musical example]

Extended beams may replace dotted lines that might otherwise be necessary
(or, at the very least, helpful) to delineate beats in long bars of short note-values. This notation is well suited to the rhythmic complexity of such
composers as Elliott Carter (see the extract from A Symphony of Three
Orchestras, p. 517):

[musical example]

In the case of tuplets, the numeral centres above or below the beam, dispensing
with the need for a bracket:

[musical example]

(See When to use brackets, p. 199.)

Use extended beams only when it is essential to help the reader to identify
the beats. Elsewhere, use traditional beaming, since otherwise the extra notation makes straightforward rhythms look unnecessarily complicated:

[musical example]

## Sustaining notes across beats

Note-values sustained across a beat or half-bar must expose the beat
structure of the bar:

[musical example]

and not
[musical example]

Three-beat metres must show two out of three beats:

[musical example]

(See also Dividing notes in three-beat and compound-time metres, p. 168.)

Only very straightforward rhythms may be written across the beat or half-bar:

[musical example]

(See also Syncopation, p. 170.)

As the division of a bar becomes more complex, it is essential to reveal more
of the beats:

each beat indicated
[musical example]
rather
than
each half-beat indicated
[musical example] 

## Beaming to reflect musical structure

The demands of fast reading are best served when articulation marks alone
illustrate the musical structure, leaving the note-grouping to indicate the
metre, syncopation or cross rhythm.

Composers have always arranged beaming in unconventional ways, in order
to point aspects of the musical structure. They sometimes prefer not to divide
beams, to discourage any accentuation of subdivisions within expressive
passages (this notation is not recommended):

[musical example]

In a different context, a composer may divide a beam to coincide with
changes in articulation and dynamics. Only when rhythms are straight-
forward and bars short might it be beneficial to use such notation:

Debussy: Ibéria

[musical example]

To use separate tails to convey the impression of short notes is extremely
unhelpful:

[musical example]

### GROUPING TO CONTRADICT THE METRE
When the bar is to be stressed contrary to the metre — three-beat metres into
two, two-beat metres into three — group the rhythms as if in the opposing
metre:

bar stressed contrary to the metre
bar stressed to complement the metre

[musical example]

3-beat metre,
2-beat accentuation

(See also Syncopation, p. 170.)

2-beat metre,
3-beat accentuation

[musical example]

## Syncopation

Note-values written across the metre, contradicting normal bar division,
express accents superimposed on the basic metre. Note-grouping that contradicts the metre will be read as syncopation. (Examples of this are shown
under Grouping to contradict the metre, first column, p. 169.)

When accentuation is intended to contradict the basic metre, write note-
values across the beats:

[musical example]

Divide up long bars of short note-values so that the reader does not lose
count of the basic metre:

too difficult to read
[musical example]

In a slow tempo, the syncopated rhythms may be divided into groups of tied
single beats (rhythms notated as shown in first example opposite, lowest line
'within J beat').

Rhythms that should not be syncopated must divide note-values to expose
the beats of the bar:

[musical example]
will be accentuated as
[musical example]
unless written
[musical example]

The following common patterns are exceptions and should always be
written as follows:

[musical example]

within J beat
within J. beat
[musical example]

## Cross rhythm

Cross rhythm is the shifting of metre across the barline as well as within the
bar. It is the imposition of a different metrical grouping without reinstatement of the given metre.

Cross rhythm is used in ensemble music to notate non-coinciding rhythmic
stresses. Except in chamber music, it is generally impractical to write simultaneously different bar lengths for different musicians (see Non-coinciding bar
lengths, p. 175).

For most practical purposes, the marking of stresses counter to the metre is
the most helpful notation, as it enables the performer to continue thinking in
the written metre and not across it:

[musical example]

Schoenberg's stress symbols are used for this very purpose (see Stress symbols
introduced by Schoenberg, p. 115).

Alternatively, square brackets above the stave may show the cross rhythm:

[musical example]

When note-grouping contradicts the metre in order to express the cross
rhythm, square brackets or extra accentuation marks are redundant:

[musical example]

Changing beaming in this way should be used with great care: when the
performer is forced to think across the beat it is all too easy to lose count.

(See also A division of the beat remaining constant, p. 172.)

Where rhythms are already complex, the rhythms of the superimposed
stresses may be notated above the stave, while the rhythmic grouping on the
stave conforms to the time signature:

Birtwistle: Secret Theatre

[musical example]

To show a superimposed metre in a complex passage, the cross rhythm may
be placed on a line and given the time signature of its true accentuation (see
Rhythmic cue line, p. 576). Barlines may not necessarily coincide with the
instrumental part. The chamber music of Elliott Carter provides many
instances of this notation (see, for instance, String Quartets Nos. 1-3).

## Interchanging simple- and compound-time metres

It must be quite clear whether it is a division of the beat or the whole beat
that remains constant.

### A division of the beat remaining constant

To indicate the relationship between the two metres, state the equivalent
note-values (i.e. the metric equation) over the barline at the first appearance:

[musical example]

Alternatively, for bars that contradict the prevailing metre, add a time signature in brackets appropriate for the accentuation. Restate the initial metre
where relevant. It is unnecessary to state the note-value equation as well, as
the brackets surrounding a time signature always mean that the bar has the
duration of the previous metre:

[musical example]

When rhythms are straightforward, it is sufficient for the note-grouping to
indicate the cross rhythm without spelling out the additional metre:

[musical example]

### The beat remaining constant

When the beat is to remain constant, simple- and compound-time metres
may be interchanged in order to save writing triplets in simple time, duplets
and quadruplets, and so on, in compound time. The ratio of compound- to
simple-time metre is 3:2:

compound time : simple time : ratio
[musical example]

Indicate the relationship between the metres as a note-value equation over
the barline at the first exchange both to and from the different time signature:

[musical example]

(See also Tempo equations, p. 185.)

### CONCURRENT SIMPLE- AND COMPOUND-TIME METRES

Different metres may be used simultaneously on different staves of a score or
in a two-stave part. Notate the passage initially in the most prevalent metre,
and change the time signature for a stave as required. Place brackets around
the time-signature changes, both to and from the less prevalent time signature, to indicate that this is not common to all parts.

In a score, after a barline allow space in all parts for the addition of the alternative time signature. (The following is an example of extreme compression:
it would not normally be worthwhile changing the time signature for less
than several bars.)

[musical example]

### DUAL TIME SIGNATURES (INTERCHANGEABLE METRES)

Use two time signatures for passages that interchange equivalent-beat
simple- and compound-time metres either irregularly or simultaneously
Indicate both time signatures at the outset:

[musical example]

Notate each bar according to the most appropriate metre. When the dual
time signatures follow on from another metre, the time signature placed first
is the one with the same written beat as the previous metre:

[musical example]

Notate whole-bar notes in the prevailing metre:

[musical example]

Note that the statement of interchanging metres such as 2/4(6/8) is not the same
as 2+3, which is a strict alternation of the two metres (see Mixed metres
(Alternating time signatures), p. 179).

## Polymetre

Any number of simultaneous metres may be used for different parts.
Allocate specific time signatures for individual staves as required.

Simultaneous metres must follow correct rhythmic alignment (see Vertical
alignment, p. 490). Align equivalent beats (where these occur), and place non-
equivalent beats according to their correct relationships to other note-values.

### Coinciding barlines

If practical, different time signatures in different parts can simplify the notation of complex rhythmic relationships:

[musical example]

In the previous example the equivalent note-value ratio is 9:8 quavers. It is
helpful to define this metrical relationship at the outset of the polymetre
(place it above the top stave):

[musical example]

Select the closest metrical equivalent in duration, in this case 9:8 quavers —
so that the note-values of the different metres are as close in duration as they
can be — not, for example, 9:4 quavers:

incorrect
[musical example]

The following concurrent time signatures occur in Vaughan Williams's Sixth
Symphony The 2/4 functions as both a two-beat metre with the 2/2 and a four-
beat metre with the 6/8:

Rhythmic breakdown of Vaughan Williams: Symphony No. 6, first movement, fig. 8
[musical example]

fl./c.a./Vln.I/Vla: [musical example]
cl./bsn./Vln.II [musical example]
vc./db. [musical example]

### Non-coinciding bar lengths

The true metrical stress of individual parts may be expressed as independent
metres, to result in non-coinciding bar lengths. This may replace the notation
of cross rhythm (see Cross rhythm, p. 171), but is generally impractical except
in chamber music.

Where possible, select metres that share a common beat or common division
of the beat. Thus, in a score, the common value can be vertically aligned:

[musical example]

(This is also the case in Ravel's Piano Trio — see example, p. 576.)

When a note aligns with the first beat of a bar in another part, the rhythmic
values should align with each other, and not with a barline.

When note-values between parts are not equivalent, it is important to define
the relationships of the different parts. When the polymetre occurs at the
outset, indicate the note-value equation as in the example above.

When the polymetre starts after the beginning of the piece, define metrical
relationships with surrounding metres at the points of divergence and convergence. The following condensed section of score (Violin parts omitted)
shows the concurrent metres and how to indicate them:

Bliss: Oboe Quintet
[musical example]

### RHYTHMIC RELATIONSHIP GRID
Where the relationship between metres is complex, it may be essential to
clarify how the different metres coincide. In a score, it may be helpful to provide a rhythmic grid (a cue line of rhythm) to show how the conductor's
beats (or beats of the majority of the ensemble) relate to the differing metre
(see Rhythmic cue line, p. 576). Notate the conductor's (or ensemble's) beats in
the opposing metre (see, for example, Ades, Asyla, Ecstasio, Letter L; Maxwell
Davies's Hymn to St Magnus, Letter 8 ff also uses a rhythmic grid to show how
the parts co-ordinate).

Likewise provide this rhythm cue in the parts of players who play in a different metre from the more prevalent one: these players need to measure
their music against the prevalent metre (see example under Non-coinciding
barlines, p. 578, as to how a cue would be laid out. Conductor beats, given
as note-values for the relevant beats, would be added to the 'orchestra
metre' cue line).

Where helpful, the rhythmic grid should notate the rhythms of the other
player(s) in the metre of the relevant player's part (see, for example, Ades,
Piano Quintet, Fig. 11 ff.).

### Parts in different tempi (Poly-tempo)

The use of simultaneous different tempi may be required to be co-ordinated
(e.g. by a second conductor, a click-track, or by the players themselves) or
else not precisely co-ordinated. When there are equivalent ratios between
tempi, a score should rhythmically align the parts according to these ratios.
In the following table the tempi have the exact ratio 4:5:6:7. The second
column gives an alternative notation in a single metre, which would be the
traditional way of indicating these tempo relationships:

[musical example]

Whether or not the different tempi form precise ratios, a score should align
parts as precisely as possible (see, for example, Stockhausen's Gruppen).
Where exact co-ordination is not required, the result may not be precisely the
same from one performance to the next; the score will, however, present one
possible sequence of events (see, for instance, Boulez's Rituel: in memoriam
Bruno Maderna). The layout principles are the same as when an individual
part is completely independent (see Independent parts within an ensemble,
p. 613; for part preparation, see Non-coinciding barlines, p. 577).

## Metres of variable stress

Where possible, bar division is indicated by beam grouping:

[musical example]

or by the particular division of longer notes and rests:

[musical example]

(See also Table 1, p. 155.)

Otherwise, divide bars by adding dotted barlines. In a score place these
through each instrumental section individually (as with ordinary barlines).
They may be omitted through tacet instrumental sections. In an instrumental
part (but not a score), divide rests in a rest bar to show the bar division (see
next example, last bar).

In an instrumental part, dotted barlines are very helpful, especially in complex music or long bars, since the player may well mark in the divisions of
the bar in any case. Use dotted barlines in rest bars only where division
would otherwise be unclear:

[musical example]

Indicating the numerical divisions of the bar is the most economical notation
in less complex music. This is especially useful when a division remains
unchanged, since numerical division holds good until contradicted. Place the
numerals at the beginning of the bar — they may be bracketed or not:

[musical example]

Adding up the beats is likely to trip a player up in rehearsal, and so should
be avoided:

not recommended
[musical example]

It is best not to use small notes over the relevant beats — reserve notes for
playing wherever possible:

avoid
[musical example]

Conductor beat symbols (meaning one, two and three beats) are
best avoided as well. Conductors always prefer to write in their own markings in a score, and, in parts, bar division is better expressed in one of the
ways shown above.

When the division of a metre remains unchanged throughout, this may be
indicated at the outset:

[musical example]

## Mixed metres (Alternating time signatures)

A fixed pattern of alternating metres may be notated where bars of different
duration alternate (as opposed to interchanging compound- and simple-time —
see Interchanging simple- and compound-time metres, p. 172). Place the two (or
more) time signatures at the start, with a '+' sign between each.

It is permissible to notate each metre as a separate bar:

[musical example]

However, it is more common to treat the pattern of alternating time signatures as single bars and to separate each metre with a dotted barline, if
necessary (as in Metres of mixed denominators — see p. 180).

When metres alternate irregularly, place both time signatures at the outset,
with a hyphen between them, for clarity: 2/4-3/4:

This notation is useful in chamber music, to save writing in the many alternating time signatures, although in conducted music it is better to have each
time signature where required. In individual parts, rest bars will require the
relevant time signature — since the player will otherwise have no indication
of bar length.

## Metres of mixed denominators

A fixed pattern of alternating time signatures may consist of groups that
require different denominators. Between the different time signatures, any
single duration is taken to be equal, i.e. the smallest unit (the semiquaver in
the example below) is the same duration for all the time signatures indicated.

Each section of the bar must conform to its appropriate time signature so as
to clarify the bar division. Dotted barlines may separate the different portions of the bar where this is helpful (bar 3-4):

[musical example]

### Time signatures with numerators as fractions

Time signatures with numerators as fractions (i.e. a fraction of a beat) are an
unnecessarily obscure notation. Instead, notate half-, quarter- and eighth-
beats as metres of mixed denominators:

[musical example]

All other fractions may be notated with a denominator that is a division of
the semibreve.

## Denominator as any division of the semibreve

Since the denominator is the division of the semibreve into equal parts, it
may represent any number of equal divisions of the semibreve, not just the
traditional multiples of two. For example, in 4/6, the semibreve is divided into
six parts to provide a note-value (triplet crotchets) of which there are four:

[musical example]

Thus this notation may define differing bar lengths that would otherwise
require a tempo equation for every time signature change:

### TABLE 2: Denominators

denominator | note-value in the time of a semibreve | examples of note-values of equal duration (but different bar lengths)
2 | [musical example] | [musical example]
10 | [musical example] | [musical example]
11 | [musical example] | [musical example]
12 | [musical example] | [musical example]

The decision as to whether to use these unconventional time signatures will
depend on context. Where they are unfamiliar and are required only for a
few bars, introducing them may cause unnecessary difficulty.

For performers unlikely to be familiar with the notation, provide an explanatory note such as '5/10 : a bar of five beats, each of which is 1/10 of a semibreve'.

[musical example]

## Denominator as notehead

To substitute a note-value for a denominator numeral is usually best avoided
so as not to confuse the time signature with a note-value to be sounded:

[musical example]

A notehead used for an unconventional denominator:

[musical example]

is written equally efficiently as the conventional 5/8 with (2+3 sempre) indicated
above the first bar.

## Tempo indications

### Design

Tempo indications are printed in bold roman type and are usually larger
than other text so as to be very conspicuous. The only exception is when a
rubato marking such as accel. or rall. refers to a single line (e.g. a soloistic
passage in an ensemble piece) and is not a general tempo change for the
whole ensemble. Such an indication uses small italic type, as an expression
mark would (see Text typefaces in the music, p. 492).

Older scores use small italic type for general indication of gradual tempo
change (accel, rall, etc.), but italic should be reserved for expression marks,
and not used in this context.

New (established) tempi have initial capitals; temporary indications
(allargando, accel, rall, etc.) do not.

### Placing

Place all tempo indications above the uppermost stave, and above all other
performance instructions. They should be well clear of slurs, octave signs
and articulation. In orchestral and ensemble full scores, tempi are usually
repeated lower down the score (see Placing tempo and rehearsal marks, p. 520;
also, Playing score: layout, p. 539).

When a tempo marking coincides with a time signature indication, align the
tempo with the left edge of the time signature:

[musical example]

When there is no new time signature, align the tempo marking with the first
element of the notation (e.g. a note or accidental) after the clef and key
signature. Note that when the tempo change is at the start of the bar, the
marking is not placed on the barline:

[musical example]

Tempo indications mid-bar also align with the first notational element of the
respective beat:

[musical example]

When a repeat sign acts as a barline, the tempo aligns with the following first
element of the notation. When the repeat sign is not acting as a barline, the
tempo aligns with it:

[musical example]

### METRONOME MARKINGS
A metronome marking may be given alone as a tempo indication. Otherwise
it follows the tempo indication. It requires brackets only to confirm a current
or previously stated tempo, e.g. Tempo I(J = 56), or to clarify a tempo equation, e.g.:

[musical example]

(See also Tempo equations, p. 185.)

### Tempo Primo and Tempo Secondo

A return to an opening tempo is marked Tempo Primo (abbrev. Tempo 1° /
Tempo I). A return to a second tempo is marked Tempo Secondo (abbrev. Tempo
2°/Tempo II). (These tempo markings would be in bold type.)

Confirm each tempo in brackets, at least the first time the terms are used,
especially when there have been intervening tempi: it must be clear which
tempo is being referred to. For example, Tempo II (Vivace (J = 96)).

### Tempo alteration markings

#### HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT

It is standard practice to place each marking a small distance above all other
information on the uppermost stave. It is helpful if two or more markings on
the same system can be aligned, as they can be clearly seen to relate to one
another. However, it is more important that each marking is more or less a
consistent height above the notation, remaining close to the music, so that
tempi do not become isolated from their content, and so that they are not
overlooked (see flute example, p. 570).

A fluctuating tempo instruction may be clarified with horizontal dashes up
to a new tempo. Such lines should remain horizontal and not be angled:

[musical example]

and not
[musical example]

#### GRAPHICALLY NOTATED GRADUAL TEMPO CHANGE
A slanted arrow is sometimes used to emphasize or replace changing tempo
indications:

quickening: accel. /
slowing down: rall.\

However, there is little need for this extra notation when a perfectly clear
method already exists. Conductors and performers prefer to mark such
indications in their own ways.

#### INDICATING CONTINUING TEMPO CHANGE

To alert the reader to a continuing tempo alteration, repeat the marking in
brackets at the start of each system, e.g. (accel. sempre). In addition, or instead,
use horizontal dashes to the new tempo marking.

#### TERMINATING TEMPO CHANGE BEFORE THE NEXT TEMPO
When a new tempo marking is not a consequence of the tempo alteration,
place a vertical notch at the end of the dashes:

[musical example]

Instead, or as well, indicate with subito that the new tempo is significantly
different:

[musical example]

## Tempo equations

Tempo equations indicate where there is a direct relationship between note-
values at a tempo change.

Cue-sized notes above the stave indicate note-value equivalents between
tempi. They must be carefully placed so as not to be ambiguous.

Traditionally before about the 1950s, a note-value equation appeared after
the barline of the new tempo. For example,
J = J
or, more explicitly

J = J precedente ('preceding'), meant that the new note-value (J) was equal
to the former note-value (J).

It is best not to use this arrangement now, since contemporary practice
reverses the equation (following the 'metric modulation' notation invented
by Elliott Carter). The traditional equation has become ambiguous as to which
note-value refers to which tempo.

Instead, centre the '=' sign of the equation over the barline, so that each note-
value is clearly related to the tempo of the bar above which it is placed:

[musical example]

Although not strictly necessary, the addition of arrows clarifies the equation
and more conspicuously separates the equation from the musical text:

[musical example]

When it is necessary to move the equation after the barline (e.g. at the beginning of a system or after a tempo change instruction), the arrows confirm
which note-value belongs to which tempo:

[musical example]

Identical equivalent durations are also expressed as an equation: J = J, or else
with a single note-value over the barline with an arrow in the direction of
each tempo: «J→.

(See extract from Carter's A Symphony of Three Orchestras, p. 517.)

### OVER A SYSTEM BREAK
An equation is best placed before the end of the first system, i.e. in advance
of the tempo change. Confirmation of the new tempo on the new system may
be helpful:

[musical example]

Where more convenient, the equation may be placed on the new system:

[musical example]

or else it may be divided between the systems:

[musical example]

### Complex metric equations

Complex ratios may require tied note-values or tuplet indications:

[musical example]

When the relationship between the tempi can only be expressed as a ratio:
e.g. 5 J:7 J, place a tuplet indication over the cue-sized notehead (tuplet
brackets may be closed — see previous example — or open-ended, as below):

[musical example]

For clarity, confirm these complex equations by placing a new metronome
marking after the equation.

## Pauses

### Break in sound

The comma (,) or diagonal-stroked caesura // indicates that a note is sustained for its full value, then extra time allotted for a short break in sound.
The comma rather than the caesura is now more commonly used. (See also
Vocal music: Phrasing and breathing points, p. 436; the caesura is also used to
show damping — see p. 291.)

The comma usually indicates a very short break. The caesura may indicate a
slightly longer break (but shorter than a pause), usually at the end of a section. For a break at the end of a bar, a pause over the barline fulfils the same
function as a caesura. Both the comma and caesura may be extended with
pauses (as shown under Pause duration, below).

Place the comma and caesura just before a subsequent note or barline. The
diagonal strokes of the caesura may be up to half a beam width in thickness.
The strokes are placed on the second stave-line down, extending upwards to
the position of a first ledger line above the stave. In a score, the comma,
caesura and pause over a barline should appear at the top of each instrumental section only (so as not to be intersected by a barline). When not over a barline, place the symbols above every stave.

### Pause duration

Pauses add duration of non-specific value to the symbol above which they
are placed. They may be indicated in the following ways:

breve | short pause | lunga | long pause | break with pause
[musical example] | [musical example] | [musical example] | [musical example] | [musical example]

Pauses of different relative duration may be defined with different symbols.
These must be qualified, as they do not have standard definitions. For example:

short pause | long pause
[musical example] | [musical example]

A pause duration may be indicated in seconds over the sign:

[musical example]

An indication of a tempo is required after a pause only when a tempo change
has preceded it.

The indication tenuto (abbrev. ten.) indicates that a note should be held for its
full written value. This usually implies a degree of emphasis, sometimes
resulting in a brief pause. It requires no subsequent tempo clarification or a
tempo marking.

### Design and placing

The standard arc-shaped pause sign (Italian: fermata) is about one stave-
space high, and two spaces wide (about the width of a ledger line).

The arc of the pause centres on the notehead (regardless of stem direction),
rest or barline. When there are unison or adjacent notes, the pause centres on
the note that is on the 'correct' side of the stem:

[musical example]

Always place the pause above the stave, except in double-stemmed writing
(see below). It centres outside the tremolo beams of a two-note tremolo:

[musical example]

Place the pause further from the stave than other markings stacked on the
notehead, except for the octave sign:

[musical example]

Mid-phrase, a pause is positioned inside a slur (as in the second two-note
tremolo example opposite).

A pause must be positioned directly over a note, tremolo beam (as above),
rest, barline, or sign indicating a break in sound such as a comma or caesura.
Any other placing is ambiguous:

[musical example]

#### DOUBLE-STEMMED WRITING

Each separately stemmed part on a stave takes a pause. A lower part takes
an inverted pause:

[musical example]

#### BRACED PART ON TWO STAVES

Although, traditionally, a single pause is often placed below a note on the
lower stave regardless of its stem direction, it is more usual to place the
pause above the stave (see harp example, Playing part, p. 524).

#### CHORAL WRITING WITH TWO VOICES ON A STAVE

Pauses may be indicated only for the outer voices, should the pause signs for
the inner voices otherwise conflict with a single, centred text:

[musical example]

### PAUSES IN SCORE AND PARTS

The beat or subdivision on which the pause falls must agree in all parts of a
score (see example under Double-stemmed writing, p. 189).

Since a player has only his or her own part, a long note or rest in a leading
(or 'busy') part may be subdivided to indicate the precise beat or subdivision
on which the pause falls. (The player would otherwise need to refer to a
score.) Accompanying parts may not require this precise information, since
the players will hold a pause on an existing note-value until the conductor
or leader cues them (see solo horn part in Sample score layout, Table 9, p. 547).

Score and parts should agree as to whether notes or rests are subdivided to
show the exact placing of the pause. Thus the conductor can see from the
score the information that each part has.

Cadenzas and free passages often take pauses in accompanying or tacet parts
(see Cadenzas and solo ad libitum passages, p. 610).

(For the use of Britten's Curlew sign, see Moving on into a metre, p. 612.)

## Silent bars (G.P.)

'G.P.' ('General Pause') is used in ensemble music to indicate silence of a bar
(or more) for the whole ensemble. One silent bar measured in strict time is
marked GP:
G.P.

This is occasionally indicated (in the same place in the bar) as tacet ('empty').

Multiple rests (see p. 564) represent two or more silent bars:

[musical example]

A silent bar with a pause takes a pause sign as well as a GP indication:
