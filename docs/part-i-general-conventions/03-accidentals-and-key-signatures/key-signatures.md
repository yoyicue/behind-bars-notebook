# Key Signatures

## Placing and order of accidentals

A key signature is placed at the beginning of the stave, after the Clef and before a time signature. It should appear on every stave to which it is relevant, for as long as it is relevant.

The order of accidentals follows the 'cycle of fifths'. The arrangement is identical in each Clef except for the tenor-clef layout of sharps:

## Spacing

### Sharps
The edges of the crossbars align vertically but do not overlap:

[musical example]

### Flats
Place each sign just far enough to the right for it not to touch the preceding flat. Flats in ascending fourths will fit in very close to each other — but keep the key signature evenly spaced, the stem of a second flat aligning with the right-hand edge of the previous flat. Do not overlap the flats, as the spacing will appear uneven:

## Key Changes

Change a key signature after a barline. A double barline precedes the new key signature only if the key change coincides with a new musical section.

### Traditional Practice

Natural signs cancel a key signature before a new one is stated. The naturals should appear in the order of the key signature they are cancelling. Both the naturals and the new key signature go after the barline (old Russian editions place the naturals before the barline):

[musical example]

When a sharp or flat key leads to a key with fewer sharps or flats, the accidentals of the previous key signature are cancelled before the new key signature. However, some older editions (including nineteenth-century French editions) place the naturals after the new signature, to preserve the 'cycle of fifths' arrangement:

[musical example]

When a key change coincides with a system break, the cancelling naturals and the new key signature go at the end of the first system. The new system takes only the new key signature.

### Contemporary Practice

At a key change use only the new key signature. This gives a simpler result. A previous key signature requires cancelling with naturals only when the new section has no key signature:

### Simultaneous key and clef change

Place the new clef before the barline, the new key signature after the barline (and in the new clef):

## Key signatures in non-tonal or polytonal music

Key signatures may be used to minimize repeated accidentals in any passage or movement that consistently uses the same accidental pitches.

### Conventional Key Signatures

In an ensemble work, an instrument may take its own key signature. (Stravinsky makes use of key signatures for individual instruments or selected sections of the orchestra in works such as *L'Oiseau de Feu*, *Chant du Rossignol*, and *Jeu de Cartes*. Holst also does so in *The Planets*.)

Harp music is written enharmonically according to its pedal settings and may use a completely different or enharmonically equivalent key to the rest of the ensemble.

An instrument on two (or more) staves can take an individual key signature for each stave. (Bartók employs this frequently, e.g. in *14 Bagatelles*, op. 6.)

### Unconventional Key Signatures

Any sharp or flat may be selected as a key signature to alter all octaves of the selected pitches:

(Bartók uses many unconventional key signatures in the *Mikrokosmos* piano pieces.)
