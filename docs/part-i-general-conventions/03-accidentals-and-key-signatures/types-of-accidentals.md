# Types of Accidentals

The first section below describes the standard accidental symbols in detail so as to show their required proportion to the stave and their placing on it. This is critical: the slightest vertical displacement of an accidental will cause confusion, as note and accidental will appear to refer to different pitches. Accidentals that are too small are difficult to read as they start to look alike from a distance or in bad light.

## Design

### The Sharp
The crossbars are slightly thinner than the depth of a beam. They are parallel, each slightly angled, so that when the sharp is placed in a stave-space, the top left of each crossbar hangs from the line, the bottom right sits on the line. The width of the sharp symbol is one stave-space or a little more. The vertical strokes are about half a stave-space apart. They extend just less than one stave-space each side of the crossbar. The right stroke is set higher than the left, to follow the angle of the crossbars.

[musical example]

(See Spacing symbols, p. 41.)

### The Flat
The vertical stem is about 2½ stave-spaces long. The width of the bowl is slightly less than one stave-space and in depth should fill a stave-space when positioned in one.

[musical example]

### The Natural
The crossbars are the same thickness as those of the sharp. When a natural sits in a stave-space, the crossbars intersect the stave-lines in the same way as the crossbars of a sharp. The natural is slightly less than one stave-space wide. Its vertical strokes extend one stave-space beyond the crossbars.

[musical example]

### The Double Flat
The two flat signs are placed together and (usually) touching.

[musical example]

### The Double Sharp
This is a stylized cross, a stave-space in width and height.

[musical example]

An accidental is scaled down in size only when placed before a grace note (see Design, p. 125), or a cue note (see Cue notation, p. 569).

## Placing

### On the Stave
The central portion of an accidental symbol must precisely fill a stave-space, or be centred on a line. Take great care when assigning accidentals to notes on ledger lines — without the guidance of the stave it is easy to place an accidental ambiguously.

[musical example]

### Proximity to Notes
An accidental should be as close as possible to the note it precedes. Allow sufficient space to ensure that an accidental does not collide with a symbol that precedes it, or it will become illegible.

[musical example]

## Using Accidentals

### Changes of Clef, Octave and Stave
An accidental holds good for the duration of a bar. It applies only to the pitch at which it is written: each additional octave requires a further accidental.

#### Clef Changes
An accidental holds good only in the clef in which it is written. A change of clef requires a further accidental for a note of the same pitch.

#### Octave Changes
Repeat an accidental if sounding at a different octave, even when the same pitch is used with an octave sign — the location of the changed octave is likely to be different.

#### Two or More Staves for One Player
An accidental holds good only for the stave in which it is written. It should be confirmed or cancelled when it occurs in another stave in the same bar. When a note with an accidental is taken with the other hand in the same stave, the accidental holds good and does not need to be repeated.

[musical example]

### Accidentals Relevant to More Than One Part on a Stave

#### Single-Instrument Part
An accidental applies to all parts on a stave — it is not repeated for each separate part in a given bar. Similarly, a cancelled accidental applies to the same pitch in any of the parts.

[musical example]

#### Part for Two or More Performers
Choral music and orchestral parts often double up two (or more) parts on one stave in a score. For clarity, confirm or cancel each accidental in every part. This guarantees that essential accidentals are not omitted when instrumental parts are extracted, or when different voices read from a single stave in a vocal score.

Place an accidental for each affected part in turn, even if the same pitch appears consecutively in different parts. 

[musical example]

An accidental that holds good in one part must be restated later in the bar if it has, in the meantime, been altered by another part.

[musical example]

### Accidentals Tied Over a Barline
An accidental holds good over a barline only for the duration of a tied note. A repeated pitch in the following bar must have an accidental.

[musical example]

#### Over a System Break
It is helpful to repeat an accidental on a tied note at the beginning of a new system so that the reader does not have to look back to a previous system to confirm the pitch. The tied accidental may be enclosed in brackets, although brackets may decrease the legibility of the accidental. For music with many tied chords, it is often better not to repeat accidentals, as they congest the beginning of the system.

If the accidental for the tied note is without brackets, a repeat of the pitch later in the bar does not require confirmation. This notation is preferable to repeating an accidental twice in a bar in close succession.

[musical example]

#### Repeating Tied Accidentals After Every Barline
This practice has been used to facilitate vertical reading in a score. However, it burdens the score with many extra accidentals and is not recommended. Such practice should never be transferred to a part to be played or sung from, since the eye is triggered for action by the presentation of a new accidental. A tied note looks as if it should be re-articulated and the tie appears to be a slur.

[musical example]

### Cancelling Accidentals

#### Double Flats and Double Sharps
When a double flat is cancelled by a single flat, and a double sharp by a single sharp, the traditional practice of placing a natural sign before these is redundant, since a single flat or sharp sign cannot mean anything else.

[musical example]

#### After the Barline
The barline cancels an altered pitch. However, it is essential either to restate or cancel the accidental when the repeated pitch recurs immediately after the barline. 

[musical example]

Otherwise the note after the barline should theoretically be a natural, but, in the absence of a natural sign, the reader will question whether the second bar has a missing sharp sign.

This practice holds good even when a key signature corrects the accidental. 

[musical example]

It is good practice to cancel an accidental in any part of the following bar,

[musical example]

except where there is an enharmonic change that makes such accidentals redundant.

[musical example]

In performance material, further accidentals may be added to a pitch that recurs within a few bars, to help avoid mistakes in reading:

[musical example]

(See also Cautionary accidentals, below.)

#### Octave Displacement
A pitch that occurs at a different octave should be confirmed or altered with an accidental. 

[musical example]

When returning to a pitch after alteration at a different octave, confirm the original pitch with an accidental, to avoid ambiguity.

[musical example]

### Cautionary Accidentals
An accidental that is repeated later in a bar, even though it is not strictly necessary, is called a 'Cautionary' (or 'reminder' or 'Courtesy') accidental. Cautionary accidentals confirm the pitch of a note that might otherwise be questioned. Atonal and highly chromatic idioms should include cautionary accidentals to assist accurate reading.

#### Uses
Cautionary accidentals confirm whether an accidental earlier in the bar still holds good or not. In rehearsal or performance, the musician may not have time to look back through a long, highly chromatic bar to confirm whether a pitch has been altered by intervening accidentals.

Cautionary accidentals should confirm that diminished and augmented intervals are intentional. 

[musical example]

They may also confirm that a dissonance with a player seated close by is correct. (An orchestral player will not normally have access to a full score to check this.) In vocal music, the singer should be alerted to all close dissonances (e.g. semitone intervals) between voices or with the accompaniment.

#### Placing Cautionary Accidentals
According to traditional practice, such accidentals are placed in brackets, to confirm that they are not strictly essential. This approach also clarifies that there is not a previously missing accidental in the bar.

[musical example]

However, since many bracketed accidentals reduce overall legibility, the use of brackets is feasible only when there are just a few cautionary accidentals.

On a chord, each accidental takes a separate pair of brackets.

Brackets force extra horizontal space between the accidental and the surrounding notes, which interrupts consistent note-spacing. It is therefore better either to write all accidentals without brackets, 

[musical example]

or, where horizontal space is limited, to place cautionary (but not essential) accidentals directly above their notes.

[musical example]

Square brackets around accidentals should be used only to indicate editorial additions in practical or scholarly editions. Editorial additions may, alternatively, be given as small-sized accidentals above their notes (in the manner illustrated above).

When highly chromatic music requires many cautionary accidentals to be used, it is always helpful to explain the accidental practice in the preface: e.g. 'accidentals apply through the bar, but are repeated for ease of reading'. Otherwise performers may query whether an accidental applies only to the note it precedes.

The natural to the E throws the pitch of the second D and B into question.

(See also Accidental systems, p. 86.)

### Accidentals Affecting Grace Notes
Accidentals hold good equally for grace notes and for measured notes. However, unless the measured note follows the grace note almost immediately, for safety it is best to repeat an accidental for a measured note.

[musical example]

An accidental for a measured note is always deemed to hold good for a subsequent grace note.

[musical example]

A grace-note accidental is cancelled for a subsequent measured note, and a full-sized accidental is cancelled for a subsequent grace note.

[musical example]

### Accidentals Affecting Ornaments
An altered pitch should be confirmed or cancelled for an ornament later in the bar. Place an accidental for an upper note above the ornament, below for a lower note.

[musical example]

An accidental indicated for an ornament should be confirmed or cancelled when the pitch is reiterated later in the bar as a measured note.

[musical example]

A key signature modifies the pitch of an ornament. To overrule a key signature an ornament requires an accidental.

[musical example]

## Using Accidentals in an Atonal Context

### Note-spelling
Notes are easiest to read and to pitch when they are spelled according to the following conventions, whether or not the music has a tonal context:

- Use the most familiar intervals — perfect, minor and major — rather than augmented and diminished intervals

- Chromatic-scale figures use sharps to ascend, flats to descend

- Spell stepwise figures as a scale, i.e. as adjacent pitch letters

  [musical example]

There is no reason to leave out double sharps and double flats if they clarify the harmonic sense.

[musical example]

Avoid enharmonic-spelling changes in the middle of a phrase where possible, since the awkward intervals this creates are more difficult to read quickly.

[musical example]

(See also Enharmonic spelling: in vocal music, p. 437; for instrumental parts, p. 581; for transposing parts, p. 253; for an orchestral reduction, see p. 553; for a choral reduction, see p. 476.)

### Accidental Systems
The traditional system of accidental use has been considered inadequate in certain contexts and replaced accordingly.

In densely chromatic idioms, unbarred and unmetred music, a reader might well expect an unconventional accidental system to be implemented. To avoid ambiguity in such cases it is a good idea to state in a preface when using traditional practice, e.g. 'accidentals hold good throughout the bar'.

#### An Accidental to Every Pitch
This system was first adopted by composers of the Second Viennese School, for the specific intellectual reason that a note with an accidental was not simply an inflected version of a natural note but a pitch of equal status. The system also means that there is no opportunity to misread a pitch. In densely chromatic music — especially keyboard music — the system can be very helpful so as to keep track of accidentals within a bar.

When the system first came about, performers would have needed more assistance with the unfamiliar atonal medium. However, music so dense with accidentals looks forbiddingly difficult, and therefore reduces overall legibility. Furthermore, there is no longer the necessity to make the original intellectual point.

#### An Accidental Applies Only to the Note it Precedes
Adopt this system only when there is sufficient time for performers to learn the music in advance — it is not recommended when there is minimal rehearsal time.

This system uses only sharp and flat signs, if strictly implemented, since a note without an accidental is a 'natural' pitch. Thus music with few black notes is much less cluttered by accidentals. It is advisable, however, to add a natural sign (if applicable) for an altered immediately repeated note, for safety.

[musical example]

The system can be modified, so that an accidental applies only to the note it precedes except in the case of an immediately repeated note or pattern of pitches, and notes joined by a beam. The extent of a 'repeated pattern of pitches' must always be clear: if in doubt, repeat accidentals.

[musical example]

It is absolutely essential that an unconventional system is used consistently. Inconsistently cancelling accidentals causes ambiguity.

[musical example]

#### Music Without Barlines and Ad Libitum Passages
In music without barlines, free passages and long cadenza bars there is no opportunity for barlines to cancel accidentals. Instead, use an accidental to apply to the note it precedes, to an immediately repeated note and within a beamed group. An accidental is repeated for subsequent notes, but cancelled only on immediately or closely following repeated notes. Add more accidentals to confirm pitches if necessary.

## Arranging Accidentals for Chords
There is no hierarchical necessity to arrange accidentals in groups of sharps, naturals and flats. Rather, their order is determined by their position on the stave.

Place all accidentals as close as possible to the notes they precede, evenly spaced, but not too far apart. 

[musical example]

All accidentals must be to the right of a barline. If they are bunched up and colliding with each other or with a barline, they will not be legible.

### Two-note Chords
The following rules are designed to give as compact an arrangement of accidentals as possible.

Pairs of accidentals an octave or more apart vertically align. Depending upon the exact length of the accidental symbol, accidentals a seventh and sixth apart can align as long as they do not collide or join up.

#### Accidentals a Seventh Apart
Most combinations of accidentals a seventh apart can align without touching. 

[musical example]

Otherwise slightly offset the lower accidental to the left.

[musical example]

#### Accidentals a Sixth Apart
When the upper note is a flat, accidentals can usually align. Otherwise the lower accidental is offset.

[musical example]

When the upper note is a sharp or natural, slightly offset the lower accidental so that the vertical strokes do not join up. The closest that two sharps may be placed together is so that the edges of their crossbars align vertically. The sharps cannot overlap, as the vertical strokes would join up.

[musical example]

#### Accidentals a Fifth or Less Apart
The higher accidental goes closest to the chord, the lower one is offset to the left. Flat and natural signs a fourth or fifth apart may overlap as long as they do not join up.

[musical example]

### Chords of Three or More Notes

#### Close-position Chords
Alternate the highest and lowest accidentals so as to allow a group of accidentals to be as compact as possible.

Place the highest accidental closest to the chord, followed by the lowest, moving left from the chord and alternating the highest and lowest of the remainder.

[musical example]

To place accidentals in descending order away from the chord (as seen in some editions) takes up more room, as each accidental needs fractionally more space to be clear of its neighbour.

[musical example]

#### Chords Spanning a Seventh or More
Align the accidentals for the outer notes closest to the chord. Offset further accidentals to the left, starting with the remaining highest, and alternating the highest and lowest, as in close-position chords.

[musical example]

(See also Chords with adjacent notes, p. 90.)

#### Widely Spaced Chords of Four or More Notes
When there are two overlapping sevenths, or wider intervals, align pairs of accidentals, as this takes up the least space.

[musical example]

### Octave Accidentals
These are easiest to read when they align. Other accidentals may be offset to the left to allow for this.

[musical example]

### Chords with Adjacent Notes
It is visually helpful to place accidentals for adjacent notes in descending order, right to left, away from the chord, to reflect the arrangement of notes. This is especially helpful for pairs of adjacent notes. It is also acceptable to follow the conventional order of accidentals, as described above.

[musical example]

When there are several accidentals for a close-position chord, it is better to use the conventional arrangement, as the descending order of accidentals requires more space.

[musical example]

#### Down-stems
Move an accidental closer to the stem than a displaced note wherever there is room. This includes octave accidentals.

[musical example]

### Accidentals in Double-stemmed Writing
Place accidentals before both parts, except for altered unisons.

The order of accidentals is the same as for single-stemmed chords, starting with the uppermost accidental closest to the notes.

[musical example]

#### Adjacent Notes and Overlapping Parts
When the higher-pitched note is to the left of the two parts, the order of accidentals may be reversed to reflect the arrangement of notes. Thus each accidental is as close as possible to its note.

[musical example]

Place each accidental beside each part so that it is clear which accidental belongs to which part. 

[musical example]
