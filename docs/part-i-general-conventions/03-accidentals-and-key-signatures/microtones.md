# Microtones

No pitches other than the twelve chromatic degrees of the octave have standard notation. Symbols for any other pitches require a written definition. Arrows are a very convenient and logical symbol to show the raising and lowering of pitch.

## Quarter-tones

Either arrows or fixed symbols are used to define quarter-tones (hereafter 1/4-tones).

### Using arrows

An arrow can be attached to any accidental, or precede a note or accidental, pointing in the direction of the pitch modification. This is visually the most helpful symbol since it requires no memorizing.

The recommended symbol is an arrow attached to an accidental. Ensure that the arrowhead is sufficiently large to be visible on the stave. It is most convenient to attach the arrowhead to the sharp-sign verticals that project furthest from the centre of the symbol:

[musical example]

An arrow alone without an accidental may represent a pitch alteration. However, when a conventional accidental precedes the microtone for the same pitch in the bar, an accidental must confirm or cancel the altered microtonal pitch:

[musical example]

#### Arrows defining all quarter-tones

- ↑ : sharpen by a 1/4-tone
- ↓ : flatten by a 1/4-tone

Arrows can be attached to any accidental. This has the advantage of making all enharmonic equivalents available.

[musical example]

Thus ↑ can always be used in a sharpening context, ↓ always in a flattening context:

[musical example]

The correct enharmonic equivalents make reading much easier:

[musical example]

There can be confusion as to whether an arrow defines an accidental as a 1/4-tone or 3/4-tone sharp or flat. The arrow modifies the given accidental by a 1/4-tone in the direction of the arrow:

[musical example]

### Using fixed symbols

The following are 'fixed symbols' in that they cannot modify a conventional accidental — as arrows can. They are useful to define 1/4-tones should arrows be used to define another microtone in the same piece.

The most commonly used symbols are:

[musical example]

The sharp symbols are especially easy to memorize as they look exactly like the degrees of sharpening that they represent. It is recommended that all four of the fixed symbols are used (rather than exclusively sharp symbols) so that sharp symbols can be used in 'sharpening' contexts and flat symbols in 'flattening' ones.

## Other microtones

Since there are no standard symbols, individual ones must be created for microtones other than 1/4-tones.

The best symbols are those designed to be placed in front of a pitch, as this is the conventional position for accidentals — and not above the note. (Numerals to define microtones placed above the stave can look like fingering, and arrows above a stave appear to indicate playing direction of arpeggiated chords for stringed instruments.)

The most successful symbols are modified conventional accidentals, since such signs are immediately recognizable as pitch adjustment. Use arrows in the first instance.

Symbols should be as compact as possible. The further the symbol is from the note, the more difficult the pitch is to read. Wide symbols force short durations apart, which is unhelpful:

[musical example]

Where possible, symbols should be attached to an accidental. Otherwise they may precede or supersede an accidental (but always in front of the note).

Make symbols as simple as possible so that they are legible on the stave. They should be easily distinguishable from other accidentals and from each other. For example, in *Medea-senecae*, the 1/3-tone symbols that Xenakis uses:

- ↑ : 1/3-tone higher
- ↑↑ : 2/3-tone higher

contrast well with the 1/4-tone notation ↑ and # (3/4-tone).

[musical example]

### Arrow definition

An arrow may be used to notate microtones other than the 1/4-tone. The pitch modification of the arrow must always be defined. Arrows will represent one of the following definitions:

- Modify the pitch by a single given interval (e.g. of 1/3-, 1/5-, 1/6-tone, etc.)
- Modify the pitch within a given interval (e.g. by up to 1/4-tone; between 1/8 and 1/4-tone) 
- Modify the pitch slightly

Arrows should have one meaning only in a piece. Introduce a second symbol if there are two different divisions of the tone (e.g. 1/3- and 1/4-tones).

### Cancelling microtonal alteration

If using conventional accidental practice, an ordinary accidental must cancel a microtone:
