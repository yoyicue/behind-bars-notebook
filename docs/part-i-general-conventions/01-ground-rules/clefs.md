# Clefs

## Clef position

There are four clefs in common use. It is important to place each on the stave so that it centres precisely on the relevant stave-line.

The treble (or G) clef winds around the G line; the bass (or F) clef winds around the F line, and its dots fall each side of the F line.

## C clefs

These centre on whichever line is to be designated as middle C. The five clefs are:
- soprano
- mezzo-soprano
- alto
- tenor
- baritone

The C clefs in common use are the alto and tenor clefs. The alto clef centres on the middle stave-line. It covers the height of the stave. The tenor clef centres on the second stave-line down. It is the same height as the alto clef (the height of the stave), but placed one stave-line higher.

The other C clefs are used to replicate the original clefs of early music vocal scores.

## Percussion clefs

The following clefs are placed in the middle two stave-spaces to indicate that the stave contains notes of indefinite pitch:
- recommended
- acceptable

(See also Clefs on the five-line stave, p. 279.)

The clef is optional for a stave of fewer than five lines, since such staves are assumed not to signify pitches anyway.

## Indentation

A clef is indented into the stave by one stave-space or a little less.

## Clefs to use

Except for percussion, each stave must begin with a clef. Never omit the clef; only in hand-copied theatre and entertainment music has it ever been an accepted convention to use a clef on the first line and no other.

### Using alto and tenor clefs

Among common orchestral instruments, only the viola uses the alto clef. The alto clef should be used for alto trombone parts (see Trombone and tuba, p. 262).

Bassoon, trombone, cello, and occasionally double bass, use the tenor clef. Some nineteenth-century editions place tenor-voice parts in the tenor rather than the treble clef.

## Changing clef

A change of clef placed after the beginning of the system is two-thirds of the size of the clef at the beginning of the stave.

For performance material, stay in one clef for as long as is practicable, using up to at least three ledger lines rather than changing clef frequently. This shows the contour of the pitches, which a change of clef would obscure.

The practice of retaining the most commonly used clef at the beginning of the stave while inserting a new clef after it is obsolete.

### At the beginning of the system

Give warning of the clef change by placing the new clef at the end of the previous system before the barline.

### At the beginning of a bar

The clef always goes before the barline, whether or not rests precede the entry.

The only time that clefs appear directly after a barline are clefs for cues (see Positioning clef changes, p. 573) and clef changes after repeat sections (see Changes after a repeat, p. 235).

### Mid-bar

Place the new clef between beats, rather than in the middle of a beat. This is least disruptive to the spacing of the bar.

Between beats, change the clef after rests.

Should a new clef be unavoidable in the middle of a beat, position it between half-beats or another subdivision.

(For spacing with clef changes, see Additional clefs and accidentals, p. 43.)

### Between phrases

In a passage of continuous playing, place a new clef between phrases, wherever this occurs in the bar. This placing overrules the above considerations. It enables the reader to see the pitch contour of the phrase intact. The clef separates two phrases rather than two bars or two beats.

### With tied notes

Avoid changing a clef during a tied note, as the tie will look cumbersome. If this cannot be avoided, the clef is best changed at a system break.

### After periods of rests

Where an instrument rests for more than a system, it is usual to return it to its commonest clef (provided this is suitable for the following entry). For example, a viola previously playing in the treble clef changes back to the alto clef. (This helps when reading a full score: the staves of some instruments can be immediately identified by their clefs.) Place the clef change at the end of the system after the player has finished: this is the least disruptive position as regards spacing. It is better than an immediate clef change before rests, which draws unwanted attention to the new clef at an arbitrary point.

Where there needs to be a change from the more standard clef, retain this clef until the barline before the next entry. This placing alerts the performer to the change at the relevant point (i.e. at the entry), and not further back before a group of rests, where it may be overlooked.
