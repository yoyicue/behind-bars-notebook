# Stems

Stems should be thinner than the stave-line, but not so thin as to reproduce too faintly.

## Stem direction

Notes above the centre stave-line take down-stems, notes below the centre stave-line take up-stems.

[musical example]

### Notes on the centre stave-line

When notes are on the centre stave-line, the stems may go in either direction. The direction is determined by context. Continue the stem direction of surrounding stems that are in one direction only.

[musical example]

When the stem direction varies within a bar, maintain the stem direction of the notes that are part of the same beat or half-bar.

[musical example]

When there is no clear-cut case for either direction, the convention is to use a down-stem. Some editions use down-stems exclusively.

Some editions of vocal music use up-stems only, to allow the text to be placed close to the stave.

(See also Stem direction on beamed groups, p. 24; for single-stemmed chords, see Stem direction, p. 47; for Double-stemmed writing, see p. 52.)

## Stem length

The standard length of a stem is one octave (i.e. 3½ stave-spaces) from the centre of the notehead.

[musical example]

(For grace notes, see Design, p. 125; for cue notation, see Size and spacing, p. 569.)

### Notes on ledger lines

Stems for notes on more than one ledger line extend to the middle stave-line.

[musical example]

### Double-stemmed writing

As stems fall further outside the stave, they are progressively shortened. The shortest stem length is a sixth (2½ stave-spaces): no stem should ever be shorter than this.

[musical example]

Stem length is measured by interval and in stave-spaces:
- sixth: 2½ spaces
- seventh: 3 spaces
- octave: 3½ spaces

[musical example]

### Chords

Stem length is measured from the note closest to the open end of the stem. This stem is the length it would be as a single note.

Stems within the stave are one octave long (3½ stave-spaces); stems for notes on ledger lines reach to the middle line.

[musical example]

Stems outside the stave are progressively shortened (as in Double-stemmed writing).

[musical example]

## Adding tails and beams

The standard stem length allows room for one or two tails or beams to be attached. In double-stemmed writing, the stem length of 2½ spaces accommodates only one tail or beam. For each additional tail or beam, the stem must be lengthened (see Additional tails, p. 16; also, Additional beams, p. 19).
