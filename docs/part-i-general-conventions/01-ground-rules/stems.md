# Stems

Stems should be thinner than the stave-line, but not so thin as to reproduce too faintly.

## Stem direction

Notes above the centre stave-line take down-stems, notes below the centre stave-line take up-stems.

### Notes on the centre stave-line

When notes are on the centre stave-line, the stems may go in either direction. The direction is determined by context. Continue the stem direction of surrounding stems that are in one direction only.

When the stem direction varies within a bar, maintain the stem direction of the notes that are part of the same beat or half-bar.

When there is no clear-cut case for either direction, the convention is to use a down-stem. Some editions use down-stems exclusively.

Some editions of vocal music use up-stems only, to allow the text to be placed close to the stave.

(See also Stem direction on beamed groups, p. 24; for single-stemmed chords, see Stem direction, p. 47; for Double-stemmed writing, see p. 52.)

## Stem length

The standard length of a stem is one octave (i.e. 3½ stave-spaces) from the centre of the notehead.

(For grace notes, see Design, p. 125; for cue notation, see Size and spacing, p. 569.)

### Notes on ledger lines

Stems for notes on more than one ledger line extend to the middle stave-line.

### Double-stemmed writing

As stems fall further outside the stave, they are progressively shortened. The shortest stem length is a sixth (2½ stave-spaces): no stem should ever be shorter than this.

Stem length is measured by interval and in stave-spaces:
- sixth: 2½ spaces
- seventh: 3 spaces
- octave: 3½ spaces

### Chords

Stem length is measured from the note closest to the open end of the stem. This stem is the length it would be as a single note.

Stems within the stave are one octave long (3½ stave-spaces); stems for notes on ledger lines reach to the middle line.

Stems outside the stave are progressively shortened (as in Double-stemmed writing).

## Adding tails and beams

The standard stem length allows room for one or two tails or beams to be attached. In double-stemmed writing, the stem length of 2½ spaces accommodates only one tail or beam. For each additional tail or beam, the stem must be lengthened (see Additional tails, p. 16; also, Additional beams, p. 19).

## Special Cases

### Diamond Noteheads
- Stem joins the diamond at the side of the notehead
- Not at the central point (except in early music editions)

### Crossed Noteheads
- Stem joins the cross at the edge of the symbol
- Not at its centre

### Triangular Noteheads
- Stem attaches to the centre of the base of the triangle
- For semibreve duration, two tied minims are clearer than a stemless notehead

## Important Considerations

1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent stem direction within phrases or groups of notes
2. **Context**: Consider surrounding notes when determining stem direction
3. **Readability**: Ensure stems are clearly visible but not overpowering
4. **Special Notation**: Different notehead types (diamond, crossed, triangular) have specific stem attachment points
