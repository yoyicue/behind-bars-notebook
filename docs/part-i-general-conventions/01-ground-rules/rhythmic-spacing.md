# Rhythmic spacing

Musicians rely heavily on good spacing to read rhythm. Poor horizontal spacing is often the main problem of badly presented music and hinders the reading of it.

Durations should be spaced in relative proportion to each other, each value taking only a little more space than the next shortest value (units of relative measurement are given as a guide to the spacing proportions).

Note-values and rests are spaced in exact mathematical ratio only when metrical notation is superseded by literal time-space notation, in which a given horizontal length represents duration (see Proportional spacing, p. 629).

Because of the excessive space it would afford to longer durations, notes of unequal length are not spaced in mathematically exact proportion. Instead, longer durations are compressed to create more even spacing. Notes or rests of different durations should have just enough space to appear longer or shorter than those surrounding them, although in reality they may be virtually equidistant. Musicians are so used to this spacing that they appreciate the slightest differences.

The eye will confuse rhythms only when the relative distance between notes or rests contradicts their duration. Poor spacing hinders reading the rhythm.

Each longer value should have either:
(a) more space than its shorter neighbor (recommended)
(b) at least as much space (acceptable)

Notes of equal duration require equal spacing for an entire system, even when the speed of the note-values changes.

The uniform space allotted to a note-value can vary from system to system according to the number of bars on that system. For a passage of like rhythms, where the number of notational symbols is roughly equal, aim to place a similar number of bars on adjacent systems (but see also Offsetting barlines, p. 489). Where the density of the notation increases, the uniform space for a note-value may need to be noticeably different from that of an adjacent system.

The barline may go where the position of the next beat would be. It usually goes slightly earlier, especially where space is limited.

In certain cases, spacing should be adjusted to create an illusion of evenness:
- Adjacent stems "back to back" can otherwise look too close together
- Notes with stems away from each other can look too far apart

## Notes of bar-length duration

In traditional engraving, when a bar contains a single note and there are no other durations in any part, the note is placed just left of the centre of the bar. Such bars, by definition, are usually fairly narrow. This spacing creates a better balance than a single note positioned at the beginning of the bar.

In widely spaced bars, the note can be placed closer to the barline so as not to appear isolated.

When there are other durations in other parts, the single duration is placed at the beginning of the bar as normal.

## Basic principles

The space between notes should be proportional to their duration. This enables the eye to take in the rhythm at a glance.

The space between notes is measured from the end of one notehead to the beginning of the next.

## Spacing according to duration

### Crotchets
The space between crotchets is the basic unit of spacing.

### Quavers
Quavers take proportionally less space than crotchets.

### Semiquavers
Semiquavers take proportionally less space than quavers.

### Dotted notes
The space after a dotted note is proportional to the duration of the dot.

## Spacing with beams

Beamed notes take proportionally less space than single notes of the same value.

### Beamed groups
- Space between beamed notes should be consistent within the group
- Maintain proportional spacing between groups

## Spacing with rests

Rests take the same space as notes of equivalent duration.

### Multiple-voice spacing
When parts have different rhythmic values:
- Align simultaneous notes vertically
- Space rests according to their duration
- Consider the overall visual clarity
