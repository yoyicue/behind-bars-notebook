# Spacing symbols

The essence of good layout is evenly spaced symbols, as this is what the eye most easily assimilates. Therefore, ideally, each system should contain a comparable number of symbols (notes or other notational characters). The spacing of symbols may widen or narrow according to how numerous they are on a system. Where space is limited, the distance between characters should not be less than 1/2 stave-space and no characters should collide.

The following spacing is recommended, as this illustrates traditional engraving practice.

## Beginning of the system

Separate the clef, key signature, time signature by 1-1½ stave-spaces.

The greatest distance between symbols should precede the first note. For a note without an accidental, allow 2-3 stave-spaces.

Notes can be placed slightly closer to a time signature than to a clef or key signature. An accidental must be sufficiently far from a clef or a key signature for it not to be mistaken for one.

A first note or chord with an accidental may move closer to the preceding symbol(s). When further accidentals are added, these move closer to the clef. However, an accidental should never be closer to a preceding symbol than one stave-space.

## Recommended distances before first note

With clef only:
With one accidental: 2½ stave-spaces
With more accidentals: 1½ stave-spaces
Note only: 1 stave-space

With key signature:
With one accidental: 2½ stave-spaces
With more accidentals: 1½ stave-spaces
Note only: 1 stave-space

An accidental closes up as far as possible to its following note or fellow accidental without colliding (see also Arranging accidentals for chords, p. 87).

## Mid-system

Allow a stave-space after a clef and on either side of a barline before a notational symbol. It is good practice to allow two spaces after a time signature or key signature. Where a barline comes before the end of the stave, allow a stave-space at the end of the stave.

Where space is limited, an accidental or grace note may be closed up to within 1/2 space of a barline. Stems must never come closer to a barline than one space, because the close parallel lines are difficult to read.

## Additional clefs and accidentals

Where notes are spaced close together, the addition of clef changes and accidentals can distort the rhythmic spacing. Although it is sometimes better to increase the spacing between notes to accommodate the clefs and accidentals, this wider spacing can be unhelpful, as well as impractical. Instead, reduce the space around clefs and accidentals to 1/2 space, to minimize distortion.

Where possible, note-spacing should remain unaffected by the addition of accidentals. One accidental can usually be accommodated unless notes are very close together.

Two or more accidentals usually require extra space; it is better not to create wider spacing so as to space notes at identical intervals, as this disrupts the even spread of symbols.
