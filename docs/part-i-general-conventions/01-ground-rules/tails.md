# Tails

## Quaver tails

The engraved design of tail is 2½-3¼ stave-spaces long (3-3¾ is the norm). This ensures that the tail of an up-stemmed note finishes opposite or just above the notehead.

The tail of a down-stemmed note may curve as far as to touch the notehead.

When a stem is shorter than 3 stave-spaces, the tail should avoid overshooting the notehead. A stem length of 2½ spaces can accommodate a tail of this length, but the stem should be lengthened for a longer tail.

## Semiquaver tails

The semiquaver tail fits inside the quaver tail. The tails are a little less than a stave-space apart. Usually the combined length of the semiquaver tails is 1¼-1½ stave-space longer than the quaver tail. Sometimes stems are slightly lengthened for this, although they most commonly remain the same length.

## Additional tails

These are added further from the notehead than the quaver tail. Extend the length of the stem for these.

So that tails do not touch the noteheads of down-stemmed notes, some editions shorten the tails while others lengthen the stems.

## Notes on ledger lines

The outer stave-line must be clearly visible; tails closer to noteheads will obscure ledger lines.
