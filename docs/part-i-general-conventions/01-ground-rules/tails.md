# Tails

## Quaver tails

The engraved design of tail is 2½-3¼ stave-spaces long (3-3¾ is the norm). This ensures that the tail of an up-stemmed note finishes opposite or just above the notehead.

[musical example]

The tail of a down-stemmed note may curve as far as to touch the notehead.

[musical example]

When a stem is shorter than 3 stave-spaces, the tail should avoid overshooting the notehead. A stem length of 2½ spaces can accommodate a tail of this length, but the stem should be lengthened for a longer tail.

[musical example]

## Semiquaver tails

The semiquaver tail fits inside the quaver tail. The tails are a little less than a stave-space apart. Usually the combined length of the semiquaver tails is 1¼-1½ stave-space longer than the quaver tail. Sometimes stems are slightly lengthened for this, although they most commonly remain the same length.

## Additional tails

These are added further from the notehead than the quaver tail. Extend the length of the stem for these.

[musical example]

So that tails do not touch the noteheads of down-stemmed notes, some editions shorten the tails while others lengthen the stems.

## Notes on ledger lines

The outer stave-line must be clearly visible; tails closer to noteheads will obscure ledger lines.
