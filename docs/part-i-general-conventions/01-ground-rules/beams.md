# Beams

(For beaming notes into groups to reflect the time signature, see Beaming according to the metre, p. 153.)

## Design

Beam thickness is 1/2 stave-space. The distance between beams is 1/4 stave-space. Thus the correct placing of three beams is:

- outer beam
- inner beams

All stems should pass through all inner beams to the outer beam, not just the outside stems of the group, as in some (mostly French) editions.

### Fractional beams

These inner beams are the length of a notehead.

(For Fractional beams, see p. 157.)

## Beam placing within the stave

A horizontal beam should not be placed in the middle of a space. The closeness of beams and stave-lines is uncomfortable to read and there is a danger that the narrow white spaces will disappear at a small stave size and with poor reproduction, so that both beams and stave-lines are obscured.

A beam must be attached to the top or bottom of a stave-line or else be centred on the line. The only possible exception is the placing of four beams within the stave.

Angled beams should have all beams attached to a stave-line at both ends of the beamed groups (see Angled beams within the stave).

### Two beams

Up-stems: the outer beam hangs from or centres on the stave-line.
Down-stems: the outer beam sits or centres on the stave-line.

These positions are fixed so that when an inner beam (the semiquaver beam) is added, it does not end up in the middle of a space.

### Three beams

Up-stems: the outer beam hangs from the stave-line.
Down-stems: the outer beam sits on the stave-line.

Any other outer beam position results in a beam ending up in the middle of a space.

### Four beams

If possible, place the beams slightly further apart than normal, so that each is attached to a stave-line.

Where there is no facility to alter the distance between beams, this will result in a beam in a stave-space. This compromise is acceptable as long as the reproduced image is sufficiently high quality that the spaces either side of the beam do not fill in.

## Beam placing affecting stem length

### One and two beams

A stem may be slightly lengthened or shortened to allow for correct beam positioning within the stave (as described above). The stem length (including the width of the outer beam) should be as close to 3 1/2 spaces (normal stem length) as possible.

When notes are in a space, the stem length is 3 1/2 spaces.
When notes are on a line, the stem is shortened to 3 1/4 spaces.

This prevents the inner beam from being incorrectly placed when it is added.

### Additional beams

The outer beam moves further away from the notehead to allow space for additional beams. Beams should never be closer to the notehead than the correct position of the semiquaver beam (2 1/2 spaces). Extend stems for the additional beams.

### Notes on ledger lines

There must be one clear stave-line between the innermost beam and the first ledger line.

## Angled beams

### Degree of beam angle

The angle of beams gives individual character to a page of printed music. Different music setters may use slightly different angles.

Beam angles should not deviate far from the horizontal because the eye perceives duration on the horizontal plane. Usually, they cross no more than one stave-line. Thus the wider the interval, the more flattened the beam angle becomes in relation to the size of the interval.

Avoid steep angles through stave-lines, as these create an uncomfortable visual lattice effect.

Slight angles through stave-spaces should be avoided (see Angled beam within the stave, below).

A long group of notes may have a beam that crosses one or possibly two stave-spaces.

To avoid creating a steep beam angle the beam of shorter groups should not cross more than one stave-space.

Notes spaced very close together horizontally (closer than three spaces) take only a slight angle (1/4 or 1/2 space) regardless of the interval.

### Angled beams within the stave

Both ends of a slanted beam should be attached to a stave-line. This is the engraving tradition: no beam starts or finishes in the middle of a stave-space, since the white space between stave-line and beam results in a thin wedge that is likely to 'fill in' at a small stave size or with poor reproduction or print resolution.

Adding a second and third beam: the correct placing of the quaver beam ensures that neither end of a semiquaver beam is in the middle of a space (see Beam placing within the stave).

With the addition of a third beam, the beams must slant a whole stave-space. Any other angle will result in one of the beams beginning or ending in the middle of a stave-space, which is less than satisfactory.

In the past, to ensure both ends of all beams are attached to stave-lines, some editions have slightly widened the distance between beams to allow for an angle of less than a stave-space. This is a good compromise.

(For a detailed study of beam angles, see Ted Ross, The Art of Music Engraving and Processing.)

### Angled beams modifying stem length

The stem that is going to be the shorter determines the starting point of the beam. This stem may be shortened to 3 stave-spaces (a seventh) when inside the stave and to 2 1/2 stave-spaces (a sixth) when outside the stave. The wider the interval the longer the other stem(s) must become to join the beam.

### Notes on ledger lines

When all the notes of a beam fall outside the first ledger line, the beam takes only a slight slope, regardless of the pitches. Intervals of a second take a slope of 1/4 stave-space; all wider intervals take a slope of 1/2 stave-space.

### Beams outside the stave

Some editions have steeper angles outside the staves since there is no need to take account of crossing stave-lines. However, matching angles look better.

## Direction of beam angle

The beam is angled in the direction of the interval for a pair of notes or the outside interval for a group of notes.

### Multi-directional beamed group

The outer notes of the group determine the beam direction. This is regardless of the direction of the majority of the notes.

The beam angle reflects the interval between the outside notes, and not the angle of the group's most extreme interval.

The beam is horizontal when:
(a) the group begins and ends with the same note
(b) there is a repeated pattern of pitches
(c) an inner note is closer to the beam than either of the outer notes. Such a group forms a concave shape.

A group of convex shape takes a sloping beam.

A group with both shapes takes a horizontal beam since there is an inner note that is closer to the beam than one of the outer notes.

### Two pitches only in a group of three or more notes

Where there is only one different note at the beginning or end of the group and this note is furthest away from the beam, the beam is horizontal.

When this single note is closest to the beam, the beam slopes.

Where there is an equal number of each note, the beam may slope. Alternatively, these beams may remain horizontal (this can look better in repeated figuration).

### Clef change within a beamed group

The beam slants according to the position of notes on the stave, regardless of a clef change. Lengthen a stem so that a beam does not run through the new clef.

### Chords

The note closest to the beam determines the beam angle.

## Stem direction on beamed groups

In order to beam together notes that would alone take different stem directions, one or more notes takes stems in the 'wrong' direction.

### Equal numbers of notes either side of the middle line

The note furthest from the centre of the stave dictates the stem direction.

### Unequal numbers of notes on either side of the middle line

The majority of stems go in the 'correct' direction.

The exception is when a minority of notes are much further from the middle stave-line than the majority. In this case it is better to have a majority of shorter stems in the 'wrong' direction, rather than many long stems.

### Groups with notes equidistant from the middle line

For a two-note group, either stem direction is valid.

The same is true when equal numbers of notes are equidistant from the middle line.

The context may determine the direction. For example, notes adjacent to the group in question may take stems in one particular direction.

Where there is no obvious case for either direction, it is the convention to use down-stems. Editions that use down-stems exclusively for middle-line notes use down-stems for all groups with notes equidistant from the middle line as well.

### Visual considerations

When groups within a passage together roughly span the width of the stave, visual considerations may suggest maintaining the same stem direction for the whole passage. In the following example, this allows all slurs and harmonic indications to remain next to their noteheads.

## Dividing beams for wide intervals

Groups with wide intervals take up a disproportionate amount of vertical space outside the stave. Such groups are sometimes divided so as to contain the stems within the stave. This is visually unhelpful as the grouping of beats is confused.

(See also Beams with opposite stem directions.)

## Beams with opposite stem directions

Very wide intervals may take a beam centred between the stems in order to save vertical space and long stems. This is provided that no stem is shorter than a sixth (2 1/2 spaces) and that the top and bottom stave-lines remain clear of a beam.

Where the outside notes are at a different pitch, slope the beam in the direction of the outside interval, since a slanted beam is more conspicuous against stave-lines than a horizontal one.

(For beaming notes with stems in opposite directions across two staves of a braced part, see Double-stemmed beams, p. 315.)
