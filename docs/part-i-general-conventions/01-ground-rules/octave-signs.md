# Octave signs

The octave sign is written in italic, the numeral '8' is 1Â½ stave-spaces high. The optional 'va' is placed flush with the top of ottava sopra (8va), flush with the base of ottava bassa (8va).

## One octave
in Italian | notated
ottava sopra or ottava alta | 8va or 8va-|
ottava bassa | 8va-| or 8vabassa-| or 8ba-|

## Two octaves
notated: 15va or 15ma-|

## Three octaves
notated: 22va or 22ma-|

*French editions use 16va-|

## Placing

Place the numeral just left of the first note to which it applies.

If a note or chord has accidentals, the numeral may be placed flush with the extreme left accidental rather than aligned with the notehead. However, the exact placing often depends on the available space. When space is tight, the numeral may be placed directly above or below the note.

## The extension line

Indicate the extent of the transposition with a line of dashes (hereafter called a dotted line). The line extends from the top edge of the 8 for 8 sopra and the base of the 8 for 8 bassa, and runs parallel to the stave.

Usually the octave sign will be outside all other notation. It must never cut through other symbols, as this is visually confusing. If restricted vertical space does not permit the dotted line to be parallel with the stave, it can be lowered or raised to follow the contour of the notes, in order not to collide with other notation.

However, avoid deviation from the horizontal if at all possible.

When there are phrase marks or tuplet brackets as well as octave signs, whichever covers the longest duration goes on the outside.

### For a whole system

Place an extension line for a whole system outside all other notation (notes, short slurs, articulation and dynamics), since the dotted line visually cuts off all information outside it. In addition, once the line is established, the player does not need to keep referring to it, and therefore information that potentially changes (e.g. dynamics) is better placed closer to the stave.

Only tempo markings and piano pedal indications remain outside an octave extension line that continues for a whole system.

### Across a system break

End of a system: extend the dotted line as far as the last barline (and not beyond it).

Beginning of a system: place the 8 (optionally in brackets) just before or flush with the first note.

### Length of the extension line

Terminate the octave transposition with a corner | (rather than just a vertical stroke, as this is less visible). Place this immediately after the last notehead(s), including duration dots.

However, the line extends for the written duration of the note when a trill is notated with a wavy line and in repeated bars when using abbreviations.

(For Repeated bars, see p. 231.)

When material to be repeated is notated inside repeat marks, the extension line continues only for the length of the notated material, not for the length of the repeat.

(See also Independent repetition, p. 621.)

### Extension line across rests

Continue an extension line across short rests rather than using separate octave signs.

When rests are more extensive, the notes between them take separate octave signs.

### Octave sign for single notes

It is advisable to use an end corner after the 8, so that it is absolutely clear that only the single note is affected.

### Vertical extension line

When the octave indication is some distance above or below the first or final note to which it refers, extend a vertical dotted line to the notehead, for clarity.

## Clefs indicating notes to sound at a different octave

The clefs may be used in a full score to indicate that instruments such as the piccolo and double bass are written respectively an octave lower and higher than sounding (see Octave-transposing clefs, p. 506).

Do not use these clefs to replace genuine octave transpositions (Britten used them in his late scores, especially for piano and harp). The clefs tend to go unnoticed, as the player is unaccustomed to reading them.

## 'With the octave'

The Italian term coll'ottava written col 8(va) or con 8(va) is a shorthand for writing octaves in keyboard music. The indication is followed by a dotted line for its duration.

Placed above the stave, the indication means col 8va sopra: 'with the octave above the written pitch'. Placed below the stave, the indication means col 8va bassa: 'with the octave below the written pitch'.

If there is room, it is always better to write out the octave pitches. However, to do so in some passages would take up a lot more space.

## Using ledger lines or octave signs

Use up to at least three ledger lines before transposing pitches up or down an octave and using an octave sign.

Never use an octave sign when an instrument could move into a higher-pitched or lower-pitched clef.
