## Barlines

### Single barlines

The barline is thicker than a stave-line, and therefore conspicuously thicker than a stem. It is very important that barlines stand out from stems, especially when there are long, complicated bars in a single-stave instrumental part.

A barline connects all staves at the beginning of a system. This particular barline is called the systemic barline (see p. 521). A single-stave part does not have this barline at the beginning of the stave. (A single stave in a full score does, however: see Square brackets, p. 516; also, Barring through a score, p. 518.)

### Thin double barlines

These mark divisions between sections in a piece. They are of ordinary bar-line thickness, and are placed about 3/4 stave-space apart.

It is misleading to use them with every metre change, as they will appear to indicate new sections.

When two movements follow one another without a break, the end of the first movement takes a thin double barline (see Layout between movements, p. 486).

### Final barlines

The thick final line is of beam thickness. The thin barline is placed 1/2 stave-space before it. The final double barline is used only at the end of a movement.

(See also Da Capo and Dal Segno layouts: Double barlines, p. 240.)

### Repeat barlines

These use the final double barline design together with repeat dots. At a barline, the repeat sign replaces the barline (see Placing repeat barlines, p. 233.)
