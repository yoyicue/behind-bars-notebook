# Rest symbols

## Design

### Breve, semibreve and minim rests

These rests are the length of a minim notehead. The semibreve and minim rests are 1/2 stave-space thick. The semibreve hangs from the second line down; the minim rest sits on the centre stave-line.

[musical example]

The breve rest occupies a whole stave space and is the same length or, more commonly, half the length of the semibreve and minim rests.

[musical example]

### Crotchet rest

The rest starts in the top stave-space and finishes in the bottom space. The bottom hook cuts through the second stave-line from the bottom.

[musical example]

### Quaver and shorter rests

The quaver rest sits above the middle stave-line and extends down to the second stave-line from the bottom.

[musical example]

Shorter rests are placed so that each hook is in a separate stave-space. The semiquaver occupies the middle two spaces, the demisemiquaver the top three spaces, the hemidemisemiquaver all four spaces.

[musical example]

(For rest alignment with another part, see Horizontal position of rests, p. 159.)

## Vertical placing of rests within the stave

Rests remain centred within the stave regardless of the pitches of surrounding notes.

[musical example]

The rest moves up or down within the stave when a beam joins notes across a rest and in double-stemmed writing (see pp. 36-7). From the centre of the stave, rests move an exact number of stave-spaces up or down, so that they remain correctly positioned in relation to the stave-lines.

[musical example]

### Beams across rests

Place the beam in its normal position. If necessary, rests may move away from the centre of the stave to a position closer to surrounding notes, in order to avoid colliding with a beam. It is better to reposition rests than to have them in the middle of the stave, as this forces surrounding stems to be very long (and therefore indication of rhythm becomes too far from the notes).

[musical example]

(See also Beaming across rests, p. 164.)

## Placing rests in double-stemmed writing

Two parts on a stave with different durations require their own sets of rests.

A rest moves further from the centre of the stave or to outside the stave should parts otherwise collide.

### Rests within the stave

For clarity, upper-part rests are usually placed above the centre stave-line, lower-part rests below the centre line.

[musical example]

When one part lies outside the stave (on ledger lines), crotchet, quaver, and shorter-value rests for the other part may move back to the centre of the stave.

[musical example]

Semibreve and minim rests must never stray across the centre stave-line.

[musical example]

When both parts have rests simultaneously, as in strict contrapuntal writing, separate these with at least one stave-line.

[musical example]

Many editions place all minim and semibreve rests on only the outside stave-lines, to avoid confusion; some avoid rests on the middle stave-line, for the same reason. (TODO)

Except in strict contrapuntal writing, parts share a rest wherever possible (see Rests, p. 528; also, Tacet woodwind and brass parts, p. 529).

### Rests outside the stave

Minim and semibreve rests are placed on a ledger line. The ledger line moves far enough away from the stave to be outside the other part.

[musical example]

The space in which a rest centres, or its distance from the stave, should be on the same level as surrounding pitches. Thus the semibreve rests move lines to reflect the changing position of surrounding pitches. When a note is on a ledger line, place the rests above the top stave-space (or below the bottom stave-space for notes on ledger lines beneath the stave).

[musical example]

(TODO)

[musical example]

When the position of a rest is displaced by a note of the other part, the rest moves further away from the stave.

[musical example]

When the notation becomes this complicated, it is better to separate the parts on to individual staves, for clarity.

(For use of rests in keyboard writing, see Free part-writing: Use of rests, p. 311, and Strict counterpoint, p. 313.)

## Dotted rests

The dot remains in the same position relative to the rest, regardless of the rest's position on the stave.

[musical example]

## Rests on a single line

The breve rest hangs from the line (as a semibreve rest does). The middle of the crotchet rest or its base hook intersects the line.

[musical example]

For quaver rests and shorter values, either the bottom stroke intersects the line, or the hooks are placed either side of the line.

[musical example]
