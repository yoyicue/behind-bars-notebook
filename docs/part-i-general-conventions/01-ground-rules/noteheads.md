# Noteheads

## Shape and size

### Black noteheads

These are oval-shaped and placed on the stave with a diagonal slant away from the stem.

### White noteheads

#### The minim
The notehead is oval-shaped with diagonal shading. It is usually slightly larger than the black notehead.

#### The semibreve
The oval notehead has greater width (in proportion 2½ semibreves to 3 black noteheads) and does not slant diagonally. Its shading slants slightly but in the reverse direction from the minim — a semibreve is not a stemless minim. White notes tend to be read by their shape, rather than by the presence (or not) of a stem, whereas with black notes the eye looks for a tail or beam — the correct shape for the notehead is therefore important.

#### The breve
This can be notated in one of three ways.

## Placing

The height of a stave-space determines the size of all noteheads, which is crucial to ease of reading. Noteheads too small in proportion to the stave make the music uncomfortable to read.

### Notes in a space

The notehead fills the space, touching the stave-line on each side of it, but without extending beyond either line.

### Notes on a line

The notehead is precisely centred on the stave-line. The unshaded centre of a white note must be visible when the stave-line runs through the notehead.

If the stave-lines are too thick and the noteheads too small, the centre of white notes may fill in with reproduction.

## Diamond-shaped noteheads

The diamond shape has concave sides and is shaded on the diagonals. When the notehead is in a space the top and bottom corners slightly extend beyond the stave-lines on either side. This is to give the notehead sufficient size to distinguish it from a minim. Diamond noteheads look small compared with the white oval.

A stem joins the diamond at the side of the notehead, and not at the central point (although the latter are used to replicate the notation of early music editions).

### Uses
- as harmonics in instrumental writing (except piano)
- as silently depressed keys in piano music
- to differentiate notes of unconventional technique in wind music
- to indicate singing through a wind instrument
- to indicate multiphonics
- as unvoiced sounds in vocal writing
- as an option for falsetto

(See also Vocalizing while playing, p. 250; also, Voiced and unvoiced sounds, p. 458.)

Harmonic noteheads for bowed string instruments and woodwind remain white, regardless of duration. Harmonic noteheads for guitar are white or black according to duration.

## Crossed noteheads

The cross comprises two unshaded diagonal lines. It fills a stave-space.

The double-sharp sign × is sometimes used for crossed noteheads, but is best reserved for use as an accidental symbol.

The stem joins the cross at the edge of the symbol, and not at its centre.

### Minims and semibreves

The unshaded area inside a white notehead is too small to add a cross without obscuring the white space. Instead, the cross is surrounded by a thin unshaded circle (the same shape for both minim and semibreve durations).

In simple percussion writing, the crossed notehead is sometimes replaced with a diamond-shaped notehead, to make the durations slightly easier to read. However, it is not recommended that crossed and diamond notes are mixed in this way.

(See also Percussion: Crossed noteheads, p. 282.)

### Uses
- in both instrumental and vocal writing, to notate percussive sounds and sounds of indefinite pitch on a five-line stave
- in percussion writing, to distinguish certain instruments or their beating spots, and to notate finger damping
- to distinguish spoken text
- in vocal music, to indicate styles between speech and singing
- as an option to show approximate pitch

(See also Speaking through an instrument, p. 250; Spoken text in rhythm, p. 457; Styles between speech and singing, p. 458; Symbols to replace repeated instructions, p. 494; and Options to show approximate pitch: Crossed noteheads, p. 640.)

## Triangular noteheads

The triangular notehead denotes the highest/lowest possible pitch, where such a pitch cannot be specified.

The notehead may be black or white according to duration. It is a little larger than a minim notehead. The stem is attached to the centre of the base of the triangle. For a semibreve duration, two tied minims are clearer than a stemless notehead.

Place the notehead outside the stave, the exact distance from the stave depending on context.

Do not use the triangular notehead for a pitch that can be defined. For example, the bottom note of a stringed instrument should be notated at its proper pitch, and a triangular notehead used only if the string is to be detuned to an unspecified pitch. If this is the case, an instruction must say so.
