# Ledger lines

Ledger lines are an extension of the stave. They are spaced the same distance apart as stave-lines, but they are about twice as thick.

It is important that ledger lines are visibly thicker than stave-lines so that a player reading a passage of ledger-line notes can take in the number of ledger lines at a glance.

The ledger line extends slightly beyond either side of the notehead and is just over two spaces long (a). Ledger lines of adjacent notes should not join up (c); the lines may be slightly shortened in cramped conditions (b).

[musical example]

Grace notes take ledger lines that are shorter and thinner than full-sized notes, in proportion to their smaller noteheads.

(See Grace notes: Design, p. 125.)

## Adjacent-note chords

Ledger lines extend beyond the noteheads on both sides of a stem, between the stave and the outermost pair of adjacent notes.

When the displaced note is on a line, the ledger line extends the full width of both notes; when the displaced note is in a space, the last ledger line is shortened to single notehead width.

[musical example]

Notes further from the stem end than the adjacent pair take single-width ledger lines.

(For notation of Adjacent-note Chords, see p. 48.)

## Double-stemmed adjacent notes and overlapping parts

The two parts may share ledger lines, which should extend either side of all noteheads between the stave and the displaced part.

When parts overlap, ledger lines that are not shared by the part whose pitch is closest to the stave should not cut through its stem.
