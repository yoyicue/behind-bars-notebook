# 5. Grace Notes, Arpeggiated Chords, Trills, Glisszmdos and Vibrato

## Grace notes

### Design

Grace notes are notated as small noteheads with stems shortened to about
2½ stave-spaces. Tails, beams, articulation and accidentals are also scaled
down proportionally The sharp and natural signs become 2 spaces long
(rather than the normal 3), the flat is 1½ spaces long.

The grace note is slightly smaller than a cue note, which is ¾ of a full—sized
note (see Cue notation, pl 569).

A single grace note is a small quaver with a diagonal stroke that intersects
the tail. It is essential to use the diagonal stroke to differentiate the grace note
from an appoggiatura:
[musical example]

A group of grace notes is joined by one or more beams. A diagonal stroke
may be placed through the beam if grace notes might otherwise be confused
with an appoggiatura.

The traditional practice is to use most commonly two, but often three, beams
to join groups of two or more notes. Two beams are recommended as they
give the least cluttered appearance:

[musical example]

Some editions use two beams to join two notes and three beams to join three
or more notes. Four beams sometimes join four or more notes:

[musical example]

It is common practice to place a diagonal line through a single beam. If pre—
ferred, in addition two or more beams may be used (as above):

[musical example]

The diagonal line should intersect the tail or beam without colliding with the
notehead:  
[musical example]

Ensure that a grace note on ledger lines has a sufficiently long stem for the
diagonal stroke not to obscure a ledger line:

[musical example]

(See also Ledger lines, p. 26.)

Place the diagonal stroke so that, ideally, white space shows through
between the stem, the tail or beam and the diagonal.

#### PLACING DIAGONAL LINES ON GRACE-NOTE GROUPS

Place the line at the beginning of a group, and diagonally to the beam:

[musical example]

With double-stemmed beams (stems extending in both directions from a
beam), the stem direction of the first note determines the position of the diag—
onal line. The direction of the diagonal is the same as for the single grace note
of the same stem direction:

[musical example]

(See also DoubIe-stemmed beams, p. 315.)

### Stem direction

Grace notes take up—stems, regardless of their position on the stave. An
exception to this is where there are two parts on one stave, in which case the
lower part takes down—stems:
[musical example]

The other exceptions are: where there are double—stemmed beams (as shown
above); also, where grace notes are attached to a measured value (see Grace
notes on the beat, p. 129).

### Alignment

#### RELATIVE TO THE BARLINE

Grace notes are placed before the position of the beat regardless of whether
they are performed on or before the beat. Grace notes preceding the first beat
of a bar are usually placed after the barline:

[musical example]

Grace notes sounding on the beat should always be placed after the barline.
However, a group of three or more grace notes sounding before the beat may
go before the barline so that the first beat of the following bar is not pushed
too far from the barline:

[musical example]

(See also Performing grace notes on or before the beat, p. 128.)

The finishing notes of a trill or tremolo are written as grace notes and should
be placed before the barline:

[musical example]

(See Trills: Starting and finishing notes, p. 138.)

#### RELATIVE TO ANOTHER PART

Grace notes written after the barline displace the first beat to the right. All
other parts align with the measured value and not with the grace notes (see
following example).

In a score, when grace—note groups come after the beginning of the bar, notespacing in one part need not necessarily be expanded to accommodate grace
notes in another part, even though the grace notes start later in the bar than
the rhythmic alignment suggests. This facilitates score-reading, as it prevents
distorted note-spacing of a single beat:

[musical example]

Observe correct vertical alignment in a single-instrument part, so as not to
confuse the player:
[musical example]

When there are two parts on one stave, align the grace notes of the two parts:

[musical example]

When two parts with grace notes are on separate staves, it may be more help—
ful visually to close up grace notes to the following measured value, regard—
less of vertical alignment (accidentals may force some grace notes further
apart than others and precise vertical alignment causes unwanted gaps
between notes):

[musical example]

### Performing grace notes on or before the beat

Unless the context is very obvious, clarify where grace notes are to be placed.
To write grace notes before a barline clearly indicates that they should be
sounded before the first beat but this notation is limited to first beats. A
general instruction is unambiguous: 'all grace notes to be placed before the
beat /on the beat'.

When grace notes are to be placed both on and before the beat, different articulation may indicate placing (clarify this with an instruction):

[musical example]

#### GRACE NOTES ON THE BEAT

If accents are not appropriate, differentiate notes to be sounded on the beat
either by writing them in rhythm (a) or, alternatively, by joining them to a
measured note (b). In the latter case, grace-note stems should point away
from the measured notes:

[musical example]

### Slurs

Grace notes are slurred to the following measured value, provided that this
is the required articulation. Slurs should not be used with grace notes on
instruments of indefinite pitch (see Grace—note slurs for drum strokes, p. 297).

The slur goes below the grace note, from notehead to notehead:
[musical example]

When there are two parts on a stave, curve the grace—note slurs away from
the stave. The slurs may be placed close to noteheads where they would
otherwise collide with beams (third beat):

[musical example]

A slur must not obscure a ledger line. It is often preferable to place slurs
above ledger lines to avoid collision:

[musical example]

A slur should always be placed above the notes when it would otherwise
collide with the accidentals of a measured value:

[musical example]

and so that grace notes can be slurred to the uppermost note of a chord (the
slur should lead to the pitch that resolves the ornament):

[musical example]

It is usual (and recommended practice) for each grace—note group to take an
independent slur, even when this occurs within a standard slur. Each inde—
pendent slur helps to identify Visually the grace-note groups:

[musical example]

It is also acceptable to include grace notes within a standard slur, and to
omit independent slurs. Although this is less fussy, the grace notes lose some
visual definition:

[musical example]

### Articulation

Place articulation for grace notes where it will be most conspicuous — this
will usually be outside the stave since scaled-down articulation is difficult to
see on the stave:

[musical example]

### Dynamics

Traditionally, a dynamic is centred under the measured value, except when
grace notes take separate dynamics. It is also acceptable to place a dynamic
under the first grace note. The longer the group of grace notes, the more
useful it is to do this, as the dynamic is more conspicuous at the beginning
of the group:

[musical example]

(See also Accidentals affecting grace notes, p. 84.)

## Arpeggiated Chords

### Design

The arpeggio sign is a wavy line similar to, or the same as, the design of the
shaded trill line (see Extent of the trill line, p. 136). This extends vertically to
encompass all arpeggiated notes (but not the stems as well). The sign should
precede any accidentals, and must come after a barline:

[musical example]

The arpeggio sign always precedes a chord. A wavy line placed after a chord
(* above) is used by Bartok (egg. in the 14 Bagatelles for piano, op. 6) to indi—
cate a downward arpeggio (but see below for recommended notation).

### Arpeggio direction

A chord is arpeggiated from bottom to top pitches unless otherwise indicated.

A chord arpeggiated from top to bottom takes a downward arrow: ↓

A subsequent upward arpeggio requires an upward arrow: ↑

An upward arrow is needed only when there are also downward arpeggios.

An arrow preceding the arpeggio sign has the same meaning, but occupies
more space:

[musical example]

An arrow without a wavy line indicates a fast strum for various stringed
instruments (for harp, see Chord glissandos (Strumming), p. 360; for guitar,
see Strumming, p. 379; for bowed strings, see Strumming, p. 409).

### Extent of arpeggiation

Sempre arpeggiando (abbrev. arpegg. or arp.) or arpeggiando sempre indicates
repeated arpeggiation. This may be used as a general instruction to replace
the arpeggio sign (this is the norm in harp music), or as an instruction to con—
tinue arpeggiation after the initial use of the arpeggio sign (as is the norm in
keyboard and guitar music).

Non—arpeggiated chords are then indicated non arpeggiando or, within an
arpeggiated passage, by a vertical square bracket that encompasses the chord.
When the chord is laid out across two staves, extend a single bracket across
both staves. One bracket is quicker to read than individual brackets for each
hand (although this is not incorrect) — see last bar:

[musical example]

#### CHORDS ARPEGGIATED ACROSS TWO STAVES
An unbroken arpeggio across two staves must be notated with one continu—
ous line (as in the example above, bar 1).

A broken arpeggio, in which both hands arpeggiate simultaneously, has a
separate arpeggio sign for each hand and, if included, an arrow for each sign.
When both or either of the chords has accidentals, place each arpeggio sign
as close to each chord as the accidentals will allow (the signs need not align
between staves):

[musical example]

### Changing dynamic during arpeggiation

A hairpin may be placed vertically through the stave(s), preceding the arp—
eggio sign, to cover the extent of the chord. Dynamics at either end of the
hairpin are placed outside the stave:

[musical example]

### Performing chords on or before the beat

A chord will be spread before the beat unless the playing style suggests
otherwise. Chords spread on the beat should be indicated with a verbal
instruction, e.g. 'All chords to be spread on the beat.' Alternatively, chords
spread on the beat may be notated as consecutive pitches (see below).

### Speed

The speed of arpeggiation should be prescribed verbally as arpeggio lento/
largo/rapido or slow/fast arpegg., and so on (see first example, p. 379).

### Arpeggiated chords notated as consecutive pitches

Slow arpeggios may be best notated as consecutive pitches, either as grace—
note groups or in a given rhythm as appropriate.

An order of notes to be played other than directly up or down the chord
should be notated as consecutive pitches (see example Dividing ties, below).

A notation convention allows consecutive notes joined by a beam to be tied
over to a chord, even though this does not show accurate durations for every
note (a). The double stems and durations of the following typical nineteenth—
century example are unnecessary (b) as are the repeated tied notes of (c):

[musical example]

Should it not be possible to tie each note without obscuring a notehead, it is
acceptable to divide one or more of the ties:

[musical example]

Tied notes must be reiterated across beats:

[musical example]

When notes are not held manually, laissez vibrer ties may be used instead (see
Laissez vibrer, p. 72).

To release notes from a tied chord it is necessary to notate full durations for
each tied note:

[musical example]

(For harp arpeggios, see Playing style of Chords, p. 357; for guitar, see Playing
style of chords, p. 378.)

## Trills

### Definition

Although a trill is usually reserved to notate the alternation of notes a tone
or semitone apart, the rapid alternation of any two notes, including a tremolo
between two notes, may be notated as a trill.

In terms of performance practice, the starting note of the trill presupposes a
prominence over the trilling note that is not implicit in a two—note tremolo.
Some musicians feel that the trill has nineteenth-century performance-style
connotations, and prefer the two-note tremolo notation. Either notation is
equally valid.

Traditionally, the written note trills with its upper neighbouring note (a tone
or semitone distant). However, it is acceptable to allow a trilling note to
include wider (higher or lower) intervals. Thus a passage of alternating notes
at different intervals may be notated either as trills:

[musical example]

or as two—note tremolos:

[musical example]

(See also Trilling note, p. 138, and Two-note tremolos, p. 225.)

### Design and placing

The trill (Italian: trillo) is represented by a stylized sign in bold italic: tr. The
sign is always positioned above the stave except in double-stemmed writing.
Place the sign flush with the left—hand edge of the notehead, further from the
note than any articulation marks. Only a long slur, a pause or octave sign
goes further from the stave.

#### DOUBLE TRILLS

In double—stemmed parts, the trill sign for the lower part goes below the
stave. Where there is room, place any dynamic markings further from the
stave:

[musical example]

A single—stemmed chord comprising two instruments playing single trills or
one instrument playing double trills may take single stems, as long as two
trill signs are indicated. The signs may be placed each side of the chord,
except where there is a third voice on the stave (see third example):

[musical example]

When one part only has a trill, assign the parts separate stems so that it is
clear which part trills:

[musical example]

(See also Woodwind: Double trills, p. 256.)

### Extent of the trill line

The trill line — a shaded, wavy line, placed directly after the trill sign — is used
to indicate the extent of a trill.

The trill line is optional for a single note—value, but must be used with tied notes
(see also Continuous or discontinuous trills, opposite). The trill line extends for
the entire duration of the note, and not merely as far as the last written note:

[musical example]

In the middle of a bar, the trill line continues right up to the following note—
head or its accidental (if it has one):

[musical example]

The trill line stops at a barline:

[musical example]

At the end of a system, the trill line stops with the barline. (In score layout,
the line stops just before the barline so as not to collide with it.)

When a trill is to terminate before the end of a note, divide the note-value to
show the exact length of the trill. A tie indicates that the note following on
from the trill is not re-articulated:

[musical example]

To indicate that the trill finishes before the next note, not with the next note,
terminate the trill line with a vertical notch. Place the cut-off point before an
accidental for the following note; at the end of a bar, place it on the barline:

[musical example]

#### TRILLS OVER A SYSTEM BREAK

The trill sign should, ideally, be repeated on a new system, above the first
entry and in brackets, to indicate that the trill has already started. If brackets
are not used, then the wavy line should precede the trill sign instead. A wavy
line without a trill sign is sometimes used but this notation is less clear:

[musical example]

### Continuous or discontinuous trills

For a continuous trill of more than one note—value, notes should be tied to
indicate that there is no re-articulation on a following note. The trill line is
continuous for the duration of the ties:

[musical example]

If a trill is to be re—articulated with each note—value, assign individual trill
signs and omit ties:

[musical example]

(The last example above is also the obsolete notation for continuous trills.)

### Starting and finishing notes

A grace note may specify when the starting note is other than the written
note
(a). Grace notes should also be used to specify finishing notes.
According to the required articulation, slur the grace notes to the measured
note (b) or to the following note (c), or include both (d):

[musical example]

### Trilling note

When no trilling note is indicated, it is the upper neighbouring note; this
pitch is modified by a key signature. An accidental for the trilling note is
either notated with an accidental sign alone, or with a written trilling note
(see below).

#### WITH ACCIDENTAL SIGN ONLY

The accidental follows the trill sign or goes above it. Whichever layout is
used depends on the priority for horizontal or vertical space-saving:
[musical example]

The accidental refers to the next note of the scale above the written note — not
the same note of the scale:

[musical example]

To avoid any possible ambiguity, the trilling note may be written in (see
below).

(See also Accidentals affecting ornaments, p. 84.)

#### WITH WRITTEN TRILLING NOTE
A trilling note that is the same note of the scale as the measured note (but
with a different accidental) must be written in.

It is also necessary to notate a trilling note when it differs from a previous
one (see example Change of trilling note, opposite).

Notate the trilling pitch as a small notehead in brackets after the measured
note. Do not use a grace note for the trilling pitch; reserve grace notes for the
starting and finishing notes of a trill (see Starting and finishing notes, opposite).
[musical example]

If the first note of a tied trill is a short value, add the trilling note after the
second note, where there is more room. This avoids cramping or distorting
the spacing of the short note:

[musical example]

A tie should not run through a trilling note. It should start from the meas—
ured note if there is room; otherwise, after the trilling note:

[musical example]

It is not necessary to indicate that the same trilling note continues over a bar—
line or system break as this is assumed unless otherwise indicated. A change
of trilling note is notated as follows:

[musical example]

### Variation in trill speed

This may be indicated by a verbal instruction above the trill line, as in the
following example. In a complex score with many technical instructions, it
may be helpful to change the intensity of the trill line itself, to reflect the
changing speed, and thus a verbal instruction is necessary only in the first
instance:

[musical example]

An alternative notation is to use a two—note tremolo with fanned beams (see
Beamed groups indicating variation in speed, p. 158):
[musical example]

## Glissandos

### Definition

The term glissando (abbrev. gliss.) is used throughout this book as a generic
term to describe both a chromatic—step scale between pitches, and a genuine
microtonal slide covering all intermediary pitches.

Some schools of thought define glissando as 'to slide chromatically between
pitches' (as on keyboard or harp). In practice, glissando frequently describes
what has often been defined as a portamento (abbrev. port): a smooth, micro—
tonal slide, as can be produced on stringed instruments, trombone, and so
on, and by voices.

The term portamento may, of course, be substituted in the following examples
where appropriate. However, port. is often intended to indicate an expressive
legato slide between two pitches, and the term glissando reserved for a more
deliberate, continuous slide. (It is always safest to clarify intended interpre—
tation in a preface.)

For instruments capable of producing both chromatic and microtonal glis—
sandos (woodwind, brass and strings), it is necessary to clarify when only
chromatic semitones are to be played. The chromatic pitches should be notated
in full, as measured or grace notes. An instruction may be added for clarity:
chromatic gliss. (see Chromatic glissandos, p. 248).

A diagonal line indicates both glissando and portamento. A thin straight line
is recommended, although some older editions use a wavy line (this can take
up too much space):
[musical example]

The instructions gliss. or port. should also be placed close to the lines, and
used at least at their first appearances. This is especially important in a part
on two staves (keyboard and harp), so that the glissando line is not mistaken
for a voice—leading indication (see Voice-leading between staves, p. 307).

### Placing the glissando line

The glissando line should follow the course of the pitches exactly Angle it
precisely between the noteheads (a). The line should not appear to start
above the first notated pitch (b), nor to go beyond the finishing pitch (c):

[musical example]

A glissando indication may be angled parallel to the line and be placed on
the stave, as long as it remains legible ((a) above).

Shorten the length of a line only when the glissando is intentionally shorter
than the interval between two pitches:
[musical example]

Where the distance between pitches is too short to contain a glissando line,
place the line above or below the notes, away from the stems. In such cases,
clarify the function of the line with a gliss. indication. Place the indication as
close to the glissando line as possible:

[musical example]

When a repeated figure should no longer contain a glissando, the indication
non gliss. is helpful (bar 2, above).

#### WITH ACCIDENTALS
A glissando line should not run through an accidental and risk obscuring it.
Stop the line short of an accidental, or angle it to the left of the accidental:

[musical example]

(See also harp examples under Glissandos, pp. 357—9.)

#### OVER A SYSTEM BREAK

Reflect the correct interval of a glissando in the gradient of the line:

[musical example]

#### BETWEEN NOTES OF THE SAME PITCH LETTER

Angle a glissando line in the direction of the raised or lowered pitch, in order
to illustrate the progression of the slide:

[musical example]

#### WITH CLEF CHANGES

Where possible, avoid changing clef in the course of a glissando: use ledger
lines instead. The gradient of the line then reflects more clearly the intervals
between pitches:

[musical example]

Never arrange a clef change so that the angle of the glissando line would be
in the opposite direction to the slide:

[musical example]

(See also example under Glissandos with clef changes, p. 359.)

#### TO AND FROM UNSPECIFIED PITCHES

The glissando line should accurately reflect the intended pitch range. Do not
give a steep gradient to a line that is likely to reflect only a small interval (see
following example).

If the glissando is to an unspecified highest or lowest note, a triangular note—
head indicates the end pitch of the glissando (see Triangular noteheads, p. 12):

[musical example]

If the highest or lowest note available is a pitch that can be prescribed, notate
this pitch rather than using a triangular notehead (see also Finishing pitch,
p. 144).

In harp music, an arrow placed at the end of a glissando line indicates direc—
tion but not a specific finishing pitch (see Continuous sweeps, p. 358).

The speed of a glissando to or from an unspecified pitch should be pre—
scribed verbally, e.g. gliss. rapido/lentiss. or fast/very slow gliss, since there
cannot be a prescribed interval that would indicate how fast to cover the
given duration (see Score sample 2, p. 620).

#### PARALLEL GLISSANDOS

Place parallel lines for parallel glissandos. Regardless of the number of notes,
only one gliss. instruction is necessary:

[musical example]

(For harp, see Parallel-chord glissandos, p. 358.)

#### WITH CLUSTERS

It is not practical to allocate separate glissando lines for individual pitches of
a chromatic cluster (e.g. for keyboard). Instead, place a broad band to match
the width of the cluster. The band may rise or fall as required:
[musical example]

Alternatively, if more practical, draw a glissando line for the outer pitches
and fill in the band with shading (see Stockhausen, Klavierstück X).

(See also Note clusters, p. 326.)

### Glissando starting midway through a duration

Divide an initial note—value to show exactly where a glissando starts:
[musical example]

When the exact starting point of a glissando is unspecified, an initial note—
value need not be divided (a). To place a glissando just before the next
measured value, tie the initial note to a grace note (b):

[musical example]

### Finishing pitch

It is necessary to indicate an independent finishing pitch when a glissando is
followed by a rest, by a separately articulated note or by a note that is other
than the final pitch of the glissando (as in the following example). Notate the
finishing pitch as a grace note or small stemless notehead. To indicate that
the finishing pitch is not separately articulated, place a bracket around it (a)
or add a slur between the two pitches (b):
[musical example]

When the finishing note is to be separately articulated, clarify this by giving
an articulation mark to the grace note:

[musical example]

### Interim pitches

To indicate the progression of a slow or a long glissando, notate interim
pitches in brackets either as small noteheads, or as note-values of the correct
durations for the part of the bar in which they occur:

[musical example]

### Note-value of initial pitch

The initial pitch should take the full duration of the glissando if this is pos—
sible within one note-value (a short note-value is not recommended, as it
gives no clue of the glissando's duration):

[musical example]

When the initial pitch cannot take full duration, it should take the longest
duration it can: the value of a bar, half—bar or beat. Subsequent durations are
indicated as outlined below.

### Durations of more than one note-value

Notate the first note of the glissando as an ordinary note—value (see previous
section). Subsequent note—values of less than a minim lose their noteheads
but indicate their rhythms with stems close to or attached to the glissando
line. Place any duration dot beside the stem, on the stem side of the glissando
line. The direction of the stems is conventional, as if there were a notehead at
the point where the glissando line intersects the stave. Since a bar looks
incomplete or confusing without the notation of its total duration, indicate
minims and semibreves as small note—values — with or without brackets —
over the stave:

[musical example]

It is best not to notate all values subsequent to the initial pitch as small
notes above the stave, since the eye has to keep moving from the stave to
read duration:

[musical example]

The traditional practice of notating tied initial note-values to indicate a
moving pitch is confusing for a performer who has already moved off the
note. Furthermore, the collision of noteheads and glissando line tends to
make them obscure each other (a). Avoid replacing glissando durations with
rests or bracketed rests as these are disconcerting (b); always use note—values
for continuous sound:

[musical example]

### Articulation during a glissando

Use stems close to or attached to the glissando line, to indicate articulation
during a glissando:
[musical example]

### Glissando line indicating pitch contour

It is best to clarify verbally any unusual glissando notation, e.g. 'glissando to
raise and lower pitch so as to reflect contour of line'.

A glissando line may be curved to any contour in order to give a better
graphic description of the resultant sound than straight lines:

[musical example]

(See also Glissandos from the jazz repertoire, p. 267, and Pitch bend (Lip glissando),
p. 248.)

## Vibrato

A specific intensity of vibrato (abbrev. vib.) may be requested, which differs
from the normal vibrato used by wind and string players and singers. The
specification may be for speed (fast or slow vibrato) or for amplitude (wide
vibrato, 1/4-tone vibrato, etc.); for much vibrato (molto vib.) or for exaggerated
vibrato (vib. esag.).

Senza vib./non vib. ('without vibrato') is an instruction to suppress normal
vibrato (indicated vib. norm. or ord. after a contrary instruction). It is confus—
ing to abbreviate either non vib. or vib. norm. to n.v.

A vibrato style is indicated verbally above the stave, and followed either by
a dotted line for its duration (bars 1—2), or cancelled by a further instruction
(last bar):

[musical example]

To indicate gradual changes in vibrato, place an arrow between instructions:

[musical example]

An unshaded wavy line (not the shaded trill line) may replace verbal instruc—
tions to indicate visually that vibrato should change. Such graphic represen—
tation is necessary only when frequent verbal indications would otherwise
congest the appearance of the music. Increase and decrease of vibrato speed,
width, or both (according to the given definition) are reflected by correspon—
ding changes in the contour of the wavy line:

[musical example]

This graphic notation requires an explanatory note, e.g. 'Increase and
decrease vibrato speed and width with the corresponding line depth.'
